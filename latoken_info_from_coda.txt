At Latoken, we help launch or discover the next gems for web3 early adopters. This enlightens people and aligns their short-term individual profits with long-term common prosperity. People will not vote for wars or injustice erasing the value of their trading accounts. If Latoken isn't able to democratize the capital markets, billions of people may remain blinded and disconnected from the opportunity, resulting in the growth of inequality, alienation, and ultimately jeopardizing shared prosperity.

We are building Latoken to enlighten individuals, encouraging cooperation for long-term prosperity and making them active stakeholders in a better future. Our vision is for billions of people to trade millions of assets, pushing the boundaries of finance and technology. We will have to overcome the challenge of listing the best assets and making them easy to understand and trade, but we will succeed by scaling listing sales and partnerships and making it easy to understand the business, on-chain, and social data of the tokens.  

The more people are stakeholders of the future, the better it will be.

Blockchain is the next wave which outperforms any technology and industry in history



Screenshot 2020-11-06 at 13.33.50.png













Blockchain enforces property rights at a fraction of costs



No need for layers of private banks, custodians, central banks, and political systems to enforce property rights over money and assets. This means a decent cut in costs to open accounts worldwide and the dawn of new use cases (such as startups "IPOs"). 

Blockchain is the internet of value to level up blood and brain of mankind: money and trading.



There are way more people willing to manage money in digital currency wallets, than photos in social currency wallets. However, digital wallets are constrained by prohibitive transactions costs of legacy financial system with layers of banks, custodies and political systems needed to enforce property rights. That is a big constraint for mobile driven dawn of neobanks and retail brokers.

LATOKEN erased such costs with blockchain based next gen digital wallet available to billions at fraction of costs. Anybody will be able to manage his financial life in one app.

That is why we acquired over million clients and have 10 000+ mobile installs each day with multibillion adrresable market.



Culture 
Why we do?

I still treasure the memories of my childhood. Sunny forest, I am 12, my brother 14, and my mom gathering wildberries to eat with bread. Was that the only food for that week? I was happy in the forest, but I cried afterwards: Why did my beloved parents, like millions of others, lose their engineering jobs and money in hyperinflation? Why were they tortured by their inability to provide food for me and my brother?

That was the reason I started studying economics, and why I went to NES—to understand the concept of economic freedom. In particular, my parents and over 140 million Russians lacked a vital aspect of economic freedom: protected property rights over their money.

My parents' money was depleted by the central bank, which printed money to lend to friends. Many of these friends massively bought dollars and assets, fueling a hyperinflation of nearly 1000%. They would sell some assets a year later for about a 1000% profit, returning worthless rubles to the bank. They did everything to keep their friend in control of the bank, ensuring that those who understood what was happening were too weak to challenge his position. The central banker was dubbed the  worst in history by The Economist. Yes, it's not likely to be that black and white, but I hope you understand the concept.



Due to lack of property rights people deliver 20x below their potential  

Screenshot 2020-07-22 at 12.46.32.pngEF 2019 CHAPTER 4 CHARTS-2.png

When power lacks checks and balances, it is often used predatorily to gain more power. If a politician can divide society and arm her supporters for wars to seize property, then war—be it civil or global—is imminent.

Weak property rights attract predators, and redistributing property can empower these predators, potentially leading to global destruction. The planet's survival depends on protected property rights. The more people who have a stake in the future, the better off we will be.

Property rights function effectively when supported by:

1. Political competition
2. Independent media
3. Independent courts
4. An independent central bank

This complex political machinery consumes a quarter of the global product and performs poorly in most countries.

Blockchain secures property rights through consensus protocols rather than politics, offering a solution that works globally for any internet user, even those living in areas affected by civil war.



The planet needs a new financial system that opens economic freedom to people and makes them stakeholders in a better future.

This new financial system will be easy to access and use, as DeFi requires no intermediaries and no political bureaucracies.

The new financial system offers:

* accounts as easy to open as a social network, accessible worldwide
* access to any assets that can be transferred digitally
* new asset classes, now easier to bring to market
* the ability to exchange any asset
* no custody risk
* digital wallets to manage the above

This new financial system will align people to build a better future, as measured by the Nasdaq index. Price signals from capital markets through layers of product, labor, education, and dating markets will guide people to live lives with greater impact and meaning.

Blockchain enforces property rights without the need for an army or politics, giving rise to better money and financial systems.

This is the type of game changing technology we need for our mission. We were born to change the world with greater technology and products. We will not stop until all matter and energy is used to build a better home for life.

Goal of life - share in Nasdaq index 

Why to join LATOKEN? 
Goal of life - share in Nasdaq index

1. Life will use all energy and matter to build home for life.

Life is program which use energy to selfreplicate.

Life DNA and culture, a layer 3 and above protocol on top of layer 2 - proteins and assets which are on top of layer 1 - energy and money. It is like DeFi layer 2 on top of blockchain layer 1.



Screenshot 2021-07-25 at 22.16.29.png

Life will not stop untill all energy and matter is used to build home for life. Why? 

Because it evolves in competition with other forms of life for energy sources (share in food niches or market). Eg. use energy better to get more energy under management or loose in competition and die.  Natural and economic selection is strongly biased to DNA (in the past) and cultures (today), ML (tomorrow) maximizing efficiency of energy use to sustain itself in the future. 

2. Future energy under management = future earnings or global cap

Modern macro organism on earth is maximizing future energy under management via price transmission through markets:

1. Investors move money today to assets which will earn more money tomorrow. Money is a store and mean of exchange of manageable calories used in muscules, brains, computing power and engines.  
2. Change on stocks market prices changes prices on product, labour, education and even dating markets . 
3. Thus people make decisions today which help investors to earn more money tomorrow.

4. You are a part of the organism. Do not be agent - cancer. Be the principal - maximize viability of life on earth as measured by Nasdaq index.

Our mission is to help everybody to become stakeholders of the future. The more people are stakeholders of the future, the better it will be.

Screenshot 2021-07-25 at 18.50.32.png

Price transmission is layer 4 which works on top of layer 3 human rights:  protected rights for life, property and trade.



PS. Yes, love is well explained by neuroeconomics. Go for a date if it helps to increase Nasdaq index.

What we do?

LATOKEN	Visionary Doers	Objectives
Mission	LATOKEN’s mission is to put financial life at fingertips. So people can use money to build future and be stakeholders of it.



Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life. Money is energy. Send the energy to transform any corner of the earth.



We are doing it to free people’s potential with the economic freedom to own and manage assets and money free of bureaucracy and corruption. So people can access money for their health, education, productivity, assets, and investments to become stakeholders of mankind’s future. This economic freedom can be spread with the adoption of cryptocurrency and assets worldwide.



Go to MISSION CONTROL>	Add goal
Vision	Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life.

Ideas into life

Why many great ideas never happen or barely adopted?

Ideas worth nothing, execution is the king say investors. People have to get through many hurdles to make ideas happen.

They still should heavy-lift fundraising, investing, and payments. Thus have little time and energy left for their ideas and products. As a result of the heavy pressure only 1 out of 100 000 startups get to IPO while many entrepreneurs end up homeless on San Francisco streets. They burn their scarce resources to relocate here for investments.



If you were not based near San Francisco, you had many times less chance to raise investments. “If you are far from the internet oligopolies to have lunches with their managers, how would you get acquired by them?”, “If you are not in US, how would we know that your financials would not be faked or bank account raided”, “How would customers pay you online if they do not have credit cards?” - a VC investor would wonder.



Imagine if anyone with an idea can invest or find investors or have customers everywhere the same day. We are to free peoples potential to bring next big things.



Imagine the future, where it does not matter where do you live, it does not matter if you have connections with authorities, if parents can invest into you or give technology and clients from their company. You are equally empowered to bring your idea into life. If your idea really may help other people, they will invest to make a try and what you will build will be available to everyone the same day.

Protect and transfer value

Why it takes more time to wire money abroad today than to fly to the moon and back 60 years ago?

Why do you pay 2-3% to process your transaction when you buy a coffee? Why would it cost a grocery shop profit margin to move some electrons from one data base into another?

Why in many countries a central banker or a politician may print money for her friends and steal your money with inflation (failing the inflation targeting)?



Today, the financial system is still based on heavy and costful layers of banks. Many of them leverage network effects, government relations and regulation to keep their monopoly margins. Do not take it wrong, we serve clients, not our ego to look better than older institutions. 2.5 bn people do not have any bank account, not because of bad habits of banks. The costs of local corruption, costs of clients credit risks exceed transaction revenues, making opening traditional bank offices worthless in many regions.

Our Principles 	“Culture is not something what we have in our hearts. It is not a set of our beliefs. Culture is a set of actions. We have beliefs and Principles and we do everything to make them working. Who you are is what you do.”



We leverage shocking rules to make it clear.

For example, if one is not following the Rule to be the client of the product her is building - her would not be able to work on it.



 

We commit to follow LATOKEN Principles. If we violate any of them we report it, make our best to fix mistake and learn from the failure. We help teammates to follow the principles. If we think one is violating the principles - we will tell about it to her or speak up to her supervisor, and of cause would not talk behind the person’s back.



* Clients First, Ego Last
  * We are the users. We use the product we are building for work or personal matters as customers.
  * Align each task and second of your life with the clients success. Architect 200 tn of your synapses and  100x more of synapses around for your life mission lasting beyond your body life.
  * Feel grievance about client, not about yourself. Clients are not for serving our egos of being the rulers of the future.
  * Get shit done - do whatever is needed for the future client success, not for career or money or comfort.
* Become a Visionary Over Achiever
  * Envision the future we are building and be responsible for this future, clients, company, and teammates.
  * Shine this vision to teammates, so they see how their tasks move to the envisioned future.
  * Set priorities and hit the target in a single bullet.
  * Make OKRs, or any progress or failure clear.
  * Think big. Count in second- and third-order consequences.
  * Have your high-performance area, limit jumping around. Know who you are and what is your personal mission.
  * Have the courage to take a reasonable risk. Mistakes are ok if reported and learned. If you suffer - good, it means you are growing.
  * Comfort is death - get out of comfort. Comfort means you do not have stretched goals to grow to change the world. Do not waste life in comfort as you decided to be start-upper if you are reading it.
  * Use any second of your life for your mission of innovator. You have meaningful time with your relatives and friends helpful to achieve the mission. Isn’t it?
* Top World Talent at Every Role
  * Rase the bar with any hire. Newcomers must be better than we are today, so we become greater tomorrow.
  * Everyone is responsible for hiring. Managers are promoted based on their ability to attract and develop top talent.
  * We embrace tough love: give and get real feedback to grow.
  * We are radically conscious and make an effort to comprehend deeply counterintuitive innovations. Those who rest on astrology and metaphysics would not find comfort here.
  * Never waste time. If we go to a date, we learn or build something moving forward to our mission and are open about it. When we walk or work out we listen to audiobooks of Titans.
* Always Learn, especially From Failures, Enemies and Titans
* Mistake is ok if used for learning. Hiding mistakes is a crime. We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
* Double effort when failed. Learning how to get out of shit is the greatest one. Get shit done.
* Discover the root problem. Ask “why did it happen 4 times to get in-depth insight what should be fixed.
* We do not defend or excuse our ego. We focus on how to get things done. And protect our assets such as clients loyalty and success, culture and processes.
* Enemies and competitors are our best friends as they force us to learn complex things.
* Find a 10x better way to do things. Leverage weekend hackathons to find a no-code tool.
* Read the Books of Titans (legendary founders and investors, not info-businessmen).
* Create Feedback Loops
  * We do calls with clients and product testing.
  * Client success managers, QA, SMM and everybody post their insights from clients.
  * We vote to express our team opinion and react on important posts in Slack.
* Be Ethically and Radically Transparent and Direct
  * Grandma should understand your OKRs, tasks, and failures at first glance.
  * Stories must be “Who needs What because Why”.
  * Give open feedback. We do not hide our opinions and never backtalk. If we suffer from our openness - this mean we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up.
  * Prefer productive open conflict to find a great solution over tacit compromise over mediocracy.
  * Negative feedback in public is better than no feedback. Especially if one demonstrate negligence to the principles.
  * Never do backtalk or gossip. We share with others only what we would say if the other person was in the room. If we discuss a misalignment - it should be heard by the person or her supervisors as we want to correct it. Otherwise it is likely to be collusion against a teammate, and potentially against all teammates and clients. We stop and report backtalk.
  * We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
  * Keep confidential data under lock such as client personal data, salaries, bonuses, procedures related to security.
  * Report to supervisor and CEO if the Principles or Code of Ethics are violated or not working well



I am joining LATOKEN because I believe in the mission to put financial life into fingertips to free peoples potential.

I am joining LATOKEN because I believe in the Principles, will act accordingly to them and will do everything I can to make them working perfectly.



I have read the Principles and hereby I confirm that I fully agree with them and will follow them.

CEO

Message from Valentin Preobrazhenskiy, the CEO of LATOKEN

“You are welcome to join LATOKEN if your life's mission is to leverage technology to change the world, and if you thrive on stepping out of your comfort zone to push boundaries. If so, LATOKEN could be the best place to unleash your potential.

In this journey, I see myself as a sports trainer. My role is to encourage you to exert extra effort, to hit sequential targets that lead you to grow to make a difference, and we deliver your and our mission. Apart of your growth, you will also get an Olympic prize - stock options that you can cash out during an IPO or M&A if we do the right effort.  

At Latoken, we help launch or discover the next gems for web3 early adopters. This enlightens people and aligns their short-term individual profits with long-term common prosperity. People will not vote for wars or injustice erasing the value of their trading accounts. If Latoken isn't able to democratize the capital markets, billions of people may remain blinded and disconnected from the opportunity, resulting in the growth of inequality, alienation, and ultimately jeopardizing shared prosperity.

The more people are stakeholders of the future, the better it will be.

Why I personally want people to be more clear about how the world works and have a stake in the future prosperity?

My journey into understanding the bigger picture began in my early childhood. I realized that my parents, despite being well-educated engineers, struggled to provide food for their children - me and my brother. This sparked my interest in economics, leading me to win a regional Olympiads in the subject and compiling the multidisciplinary knowlege recieved into a World Model. Later I leveraged the knowledge to close the long positions at my hedge fund a few days before the invasion to Ukraine started, and figure out the technology to build a global business aligning the people to prevent wars. On the way, I launched the Global Education program, which has since provided over 770 scholarships for master's degrees abroad.  
LATOKEN is the perfect product to fulfill my lifelong mission of helping people understand how the world works and become stakeholders of the future.


Welcome to join us in building the future together,

Valentin”

BIO

Valentin, before founding LATOKEN, was a serial entrepreneur, tech ecosystem builder and hedge fund manager.  

He began his journey at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, working as an energy strategy consultant. His interest in financial markets led him to hedge funds, where he rose to the position of Director at Marcuard Spectrum, a hedge fund managing over $180 million in assets (part of the Marcuard group with $3bn+ AUM). He founded Avega Capital, a hedge fund which he closed on February 29, 2014, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to a subsequent market decline.

Valentin considered requalifying in global markets and competing with Wall Street or venturing into uncharted frontiers of tech. He chose the latter and launched the home equity marketplace Zalogo. To gain tech expertise, Valentin joined the Founder Institute, a leading global tech incubator with over $20B in alumni company value, as a part-time Director, and later hosted over 700 meetups. He contributes to Web3 education as a keynote speaker at 20+ events, and with LATOKEN forums attended by two presidents.

Valentin educates technology enthusiasts and himself on how to build a tech unicorn. In his #nakedmanagement publications, he emphasizes that startups exist primarily for their greater transparency due to smaller size and higher stock options, which help solve the principal-agent problem and develop a sports culture. Otherwise, startups should not exist as legacy giants have a vast user base with lower acquisition costs for new products and a larger resource pool.

 

  Valentin's world model is based on several key principles:

* The goal of life is its viability, which can be measured as the global economy capitalization (future output).
* Capitalization is driven by the  global brain of investors who optimize resource allocation by investing in prospective tech and cultures.
* Economic selection, coupled with price signal transmission from capital markets to products, labor, education, and dating markets, optimizes people's goals, values, and future output.
* Price transmission works if property rights are protected and markets are free to access.
* The more people think about and have stakes in the future, the better it will be. Thus, trading should be widespread.
* A successful startup is a rare mutation in culture and product that will spread and become the future.
* Joining a startup with an ambition to change the world means joining an Olympic team - it requires forgetting about a “normal” life and culture of comfort and embracing exceptional effort.

Valentin also wants to clarify some common misconceptions:

* Only 1 out of 10,000 startup attempts are successful and grow to become unicorns.
* Start-uppers are either unemployable down-shifters or champions.
* Traders are either uninformed gamblers or planetary managers.
* The internet transfers information, while blockchain transfers value.

One of Valentin's main personal objectives is to build a culture and a team that can shift frontiers to build the future. He calls this the "Visionary Champions Culture", which is characterized by:

* Put clients first, and ego last.
* Full responsibility to Deliver.
* Torture to greatness, as we belive in you.
* Candid feedback, no talking behind backs.
* Use any feedback to grow and never give up, never quit.

Roles


Get Stock Options

“if you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on—don’t ask what seat.”

Eric Schmidt 

We overpay to great performers with stocks

If you are a great fit and we do our job really well, you should earn 10-1000x of your any other next job market option. 

We allocate 20% of company shares to the team. That is 200% of the industry average for Series B SAAS or Fintech companies accordingly to Carta.

Screenshot 2020-11-04 at 14.11.32.png

Source: Carta

Why do we overpay with stocks to Principals?

As Andreessen puts it: “New companies generally should not exist. As existing companies have pretty happy clients, teams, and resources. Startups should punch through status quo.” This means exceptional results of the team, unseen by well established companies. 

Why startups may over perform advantages of well established companies?

- Because principals beat agents.

Startups smaller team size helps to make teammates performance transparent and startups can reward with greater stocks upside. These are two powerful tools to solve the Principal-agent and Free rider problems. 

“Stock Options is a recommendation straight out of something called “agency theory”, that says that you have to align the interests of the people managing the firm with the interests of its shareholders. 

Otherwise, they will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful... ” Freek Vermeulen @ Harvard Business Review 2009

I would add that team “will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful..” because top performers or principals would be wiped out by agents. Stocks empower principals and discourage agents. Because principal’s utility function value future impact for clients, while agent prefer short term benefit of comfort and lack of responsibility.

Ask yourself, is your teammate value comfort and lack of responsibility today or her prefer to grow to benefit clients in the future. Or in monetary terms, is her value monthly pay check or stock options? In other words, does her put first ego or clients?

Decrease monthly pay-check to wipe out agents and overpay to principals with stocks



Still, some agents may both value equity and prefer Free rider strategy where others grow capitalisation while her is blurring her underperformance. Ambiguity of innovation undermines performance transparency despite of smaller team benefits. Startups create new professions which have no performance benchmarks or direct metrics to measure her performance. Is her task really doable? 

This mean an agent can mislead others with her actual results or find excuses why desirable results are impossible. If such teammate earn the same stock options while making less investment with effort, than why would other teammates pursue a different strategy? Effort now seems as a loosing strategy to Free riding strategy. Effort is not a Nash stable strategy anymore. 

Furthermore, transparency will decline with acceleration when cooperation to cover each other give additional  advantage. Team will sneak to adequate performance killing startup’s advantage over legacy companies to seize marketshare. Stock value is nothing now. Remaining principals quit.  

Be the principal and force agents out

Agents cover each other when they know details of execution unknown to principals. They leverage asymmetry of information to benefit themselves at expense of principals. That is the definition of an agent. Asymmetry of information is the root cause of the principal-agent problem.

If you react on weak performance, misleading statements, excuses - you are likely to be principal.  Other principals are interested to reward you with greater stock bonus if you will increase value of all stocks. Principals are interested to push agents out and redistribute their unvested stocks between remaining or new-coming principals. At the same time founder and investors can not get stocks of pushed out agents as team stock pool is fixed at 20%. So they have no other interest then to maximize stocks value by oprimizing team pool between principals. The team of principals have even stronger incentives to push agents out as they get both stocks value growth and get more stocks (of pushed out agents). 

Principals are the main LATOKEN asset. Principals are your main asset as you are a stakeholder of LATOKEN. Remove asymmetries of information and agents. Do not tolerate lack of effort and adequate performance. Give brutal open feedback. Grow as a Principal!

To sum up, we overpay to encourage those who:  

* challenge lack of transparency and performance or excuse seeking
* hire and grow leaders who are stronger than herself
* lead hackathons and grow over weekends
* volunteer as a scrum master
* show initiatives outside of your current scope, after you really done your job greatly

 If you do the above and not feel overpaid - tell to supervisor or ceo

Factor in growth

In startup land, the company you pick is more important than everything else: it’s more important than the role, it’s more important than your salary, and it’s more important than the projected value of your equity grant. Look at the guy who painted the walls on the original Facebook office. As Eric Schmidt told Sheryl Sandberg when she was considering joining Google, “if you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on—don’t ask what seat.”

Почему LATOKEN?

В Латокен мы помогаем запускать и покупать стартапы будущего. Это помогает предпринимателям получить поддержку, а инвесторам заработать. Мы согласуем краткосрочные эгоистичные интересы людей с долгосрочным общим процветанием. Инвесторы не голосуют за войны или несправедливость, стирающую стоимость их торговых счетов. Если Latoken не сможет демократизировать рынки капитала, миллиарды людей могут остаться оторванными от возможностей участвовать в создании будущего и зарабатывании на нем, что приведет к росту неравенства, разобщенности и в конечном итоге поставит под угрозу общее процветание.

Нам понадобится научиться листить лучшие токены первыми, а также сделать их ликвидными и легко понятными для торговли. Для этого мы используем ИИ, автоматизируя и расширяя продажи, а также обогащая информацию о токенах данными ончейн и социальными данными.

А самое главное, мы строим команду, которая на это способна. Мы считаем, что программировать научится ИИ, поэтому характер важнее навыков разработки.

Career Review

Why Big3 alumni lead Fortune 500 legacy companies, not tech companies, and earn 10-100x less than tech CEOs?

First, after the dot-com bubble tech job was taboo for Big 3 alumni. The consultancy business model is based on the firm brand reputation, so hard workers are selected and taught to avoid anything risky for the firm brand. The dot-com crash scandals of tech investors and founders committing suicide were a no go for risk-averse big 3 alumni.  

Second, tech companies' agile culture leaves little space for the value of external consultants. Thus big3 advise mostly legacy clients in the US.

Third, structuring and hardworking is not enough. Tech needs creativity and making working products, rather than rock-solid,  world proved and well-explained advice.

In the US in 2000x the emergence of private equity and later hedge funds stripped talent from consultancy. In 2010th startups eclipsed hedge funds as the top talent destination. Over the last decade, top startup CEOs earned 10x to top hedge funds CEOs. Top hedge fund CEOs earned 10x comparing to CEOs of legacies like consumer retail offline or banks.

In Russia stagnating capital markets and flee of capital markets firms to London left Big3 as the mainstream destination for top talent. Big3 strive to maintain standards by rotating consultants btw international offices, however, culture adapts to the local market. The last scandal on the restrictions on the firm teammates' political rights is a good example. 

The shrinking private market and growing state business mean a growing pressure for politically-driven culture and slides. 

The strong HR brand still means inflow of talent density to be educated pretty the same and the same basic operations or state strategic slides disconnected with the future market needs. This means the less future value of such experience on the job market. I bet most of the product managers in HH or Yandex, are growing their future value relatively faster (while standards are more volatile in this professional segment).  

Some champions dare to get into the new tech rocket ships - they will build the future. 

Thoughts?

PS. Btw Harvard, Yale invested in digital gold BTC. Crypto is not a taboo anymore like porn driven internet was. Blockchain startups will worth $50+ trillion as they cut the cost of political systems to enforce property rights. Property rights coupled with market competition are fundamental for modern incentive structure and the reason for economic growth.

Do not listen to your risk averse friends advising state legacy. Be openminded. Think big.  You were born to change the world, not to meet the expectations of parents or friends. Get into a rocket.

Get Stock Options 
Investors vs. Employees

* February 23, 2017
* Henry Ward

 

When I arrived in Silicon Valley in 2010, I was told standard employee option pools were 15% of the post-money fully diluted. A couple of years later, I was told the standard was 12%. Now I hear 10%. It feels like employee option pool sizes are decreasing and the Carta data backs this up.

2021-09-28_19-04-44.png

Average option pool percentages by round and year (Carta data)

Equity allocation is a zero-sum game between investors and employees.

Equity-hungry investors buy equity while equity-hungry employees earn it. Both care deeply about every point of equity but for different reasons.

Investors care about equity because it’s their business model. While CEOs have discretionary authority to spend millions of dollars of operating capital, issuing one option grant worth $0.10 requires Board approval. This is how important equity ownership is in the venture capital business model. Employees care about equity because of scarcity — there’s little to go around so every bit counts.

CEO/Founders tend to be equity-neutral in cap table negotiations. Their ownership stake is set at founding and rarely changes. And the relative size and cost basis of their ownership means small changes in the cap table become rounding errors in their personal economics.

The CEO negotiates term sheets with investors and offer letters with employees. But they are a middleman without a personal stake in the equity allocation decision. Investors and employees mistakenly believe they’re competing with the CEO for equity because that is who they negotiate with. But economically they are competing with each other. This undercurrent is the single most misunderstood driver of tension on the cap table.

Employee ownership is decreasing because these equity decisions are made in board meetings, where investors have a seat and employees don’t.

Appendix A

Last October we did an analysis of how Carta employee ownership compared to 10 randomly chosen Series B SAAS or Fintech companies. Below are the high-level results. A great question for employees evaluating startups is to ask how much of the company is already employee owned.

Protect human rights

Human Rights are:

* Life
* Property
* Free Trade



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ynjVw1K5WA

Nobel Prize 1993, Douglas North

Enforce human rights or people will kill competitors and seize their property instead of making better products and lowering prices.

https://youtu.be/A2xhmlpUKd8?t=1830

Political machines costs quarter of the global economy

Political machines are system of powers defining who shape and enforce the rules for nations.
Their design may vary from civil war, stationary bandit, kleptocracy or to democracy. Most of the democracies are likely to protect the human rights enabling free markets and result in output per capita higher by magnitude. 

Most of the democracies evolved to have 4 mechanisms:

1. Political competition 
  * Are there political competitors fighting for a median vote? 
  * Can a populist win election by offering property redistribution?
  * Can politicians kill one another?

2. Independent media

  * Can incumbent politician ask media to hide investigations done by his political competitors? 

3. Independent courts

  * Can a politician ask courts to help him to seize property from less loyal to more loyal?  

4. Independent central bank

  * Can a politician ask central bank to print money to buy votes or guns?
  * Can a politician or banker bribe or kill a central banker to avoid capital adequacy requirement or investigation of washing bribes?



Blockchain enforces property rights without the political machines and thus unlock free markets across the world to produce a quadrillion value.


Make Stakeholders

https://youtu.be/axWt4HVT7iY?t=25

If people are stakeholders of the future, they are aligned to make it better. 

If they are not the stakeholders, they might prefer to destroy it. 

Natural and economic selection are the tough evolutionary force. The force imply a conflict to determine which  of the few innovations will be spread, and which of the cultures and even countries will fade away. Would this conflict turn into a doomsday if a deadly technology becomes widely available?

Humankind needs everybody to be stakeholders of the better future to ensure technology is not used against itself. If one is not the winner, he is still stakeholder. If one is not a stakeholder by a mistake, there are should be plenty of people around who have an opportunity and thus motivated to take care about this person. If it is a dictator who have a better chance to save his chair and life with the help of terrorism, there should be stakeholders around who want to change her mind. If it is an angry Joker there should be stakeholders around to help her to ease the conflict and give an opportunity.



No one can stop the spread of technology for a long time, however one can cut equal opportunity and the future. Blockchain can not be stopped.

There are looters and those who want to protect the human rights of the looters, while keeping them accountable for violations of the human rights.

Do looters feel unequal opportunity and their rights violated to have excuse to steal property? What if they have a mass distraction weapon at their hand? That is a pretty hard complexity we should learn to manage together.

Equal opportunity to pass the great filter.

The Economic Freedom



I still treasure the memories of my childhood. Sunny forest, I am 12, my brother 14 and my mom gathering some wildberries to eat it with bread. Was that the only food for that week? I was happy at the forest, but I was crying afterwards: Why my beloved parents lost their engineering jobs, and money in hyperinflation. Why they were tortured by their inability to buy food for me and my brother? 

That was the reason why I started to study economics and figure out the economic freedom concept. In particular, my parents and 140+ millions Russians did not have a vital economic freedom: protected property rights on their money.

My parents’ money were stripped by the central bank. The bank printed money to lend to central banker friends. Many of them massively bought dollars and assets, grilling hyperinflation of nearly 1000%. They would-sell some assets in a year with c.1000%  profit to return worthless rubles to the bank. They would do everything to keep his friend to reign the bank, so those who understands what is going on are too weak to push him out of the chair. The central banker was called the worst in history in the Economist.

The Vision Summary

LATOKEN	Visionary Doers	Objectives
Mission	LATOKEN’s mission is to put financial life at fingertips. So people can use money to build future and be stakeholders of it.



Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life. Money is energy. Send the energy to transform any corner of the earth.



We are doing it to free people’s potential with the economic freedom to own and manage assets and money free of bureaucracy and corruption. So people can access money for their health, education, productivity, assets, and investments to become stakeholders of mankind’s future. This economic freedom can be spread with the adoption of cryptocurrency and assets worldwide.



Go to MISSION CONTROL>	Add goal
Vision	Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life.

Ideas into life

Why many great ideas never happen or barely adopted?

Ideas worth nothing, execution is the king say investors. People have to get through many hurdles to make ideas happen.

They still should heavy-lift fundraising, investing, and payments. Thus have little time and energy left for their ideas and products. As a result of the heavy pressure only 1 out of 100 000 startups get to IPO while many entrepreneurs end up homeless on San Francisco streets. They burn their scarce resources to relocate here for investments.



If you were not based near San Francisco, you had many times less chance to raise investments. “If you are far from the internet oligopolies to have lunches with their managers, how would you get acquired by them?”, “If you are not in US, how would we know that your financials would not be faked or bank account raided”, “How would customers pay you online if they do not have credit cards?” - a VC investor would wonder.



Imagine if anyone with an idea can invest or find investors or have customers everywhere the same day. We are to free peoples potential to bring next big things.



Imagine the future, where it does not matter where do you live, it does not matter if you have connections with authorities, if parents can invest into you or give technology and clients from their company. You are equally empowered to bring your idea into life. If your idea really may help other people, they will invest to make a try and what you will build will be available to everyone the same day.

Protect and transfer value

Why it takes more time to wire money abroad today than to fly to the moon and back 60 years ago?

Why do you pay 2-3% to process your transaction when you buy a coffee? Why would it cost a grocery shop profit margin to move some electrons from one data base into another?

Why in many countries a central banker or a politician may print money for her friends and steal your money with inflation (failing the inflation targeting)?



Today, the financial system is still based on heavy and costful layers of banks. Many of them leverage network effects, government relations and regulation to keep their monopoly margins. Do not take it wrong, we serve clients, not our ego to look better than older institutions. 2.5 bn people do not have any bank account, not because of bad habits of banks. The costs of local corruption, costs of clients credit risks exceed transaction revenues, making opening traditional bank offices worthless in many regions.

Our Principles 	“Culture is not something what we have in our hearts. It is not a set of our beliefs. Culture is a set of actions. We have beliefs and Principles and we do everything to make them working. Who you are is what you do.”



We leverage shocking rules to make it clear.

For example, if one is not following the Rule to be the client of the product her is building - her would not be able to work on it.



 

We commit to follow LATOKEN Principles. If we violate any of them we report it, make our best to fix mistake and learn from the failure. We help teammates to follow the principles. If we think one is violating the principles - we will tell about it to her or speak up to her supervisor, and of cause would not talk behind the person’s back.



* Clients First, Ego Last
  * We are the users. We use the product we are building for work or personal matters as customers.
  * Align each task and second of your life with the clients success. Architect 200 tn of your synapses and  100x more of synapses around for your life mission lasting beyond your body life.
  * Feel grievance about client, not about yourself. Clients are not for serving our egos of being the rulers of the future.
  * Get shit done - do whatever is needed for the future client success, not for career or money or comfort.
* Become a Visionary Over Achiever
  * Envision the future we are building and be responsible for this future, clients, company, and teammates.
  * Shine this vision to teammates, so they see how their tasks move to the envisioned future.
  * Set priorities and hit the target in a single bullet.
  * Make OKRs, or any progress or failure clear.
  * Think big. Count in second- and third-order consequences.
  * Have your high-performance area, limit jumping around. Know who you are and what is your personal mission.
  * Have the courage to take a reasonable risk. Mistakes are ok if reported and learned. If you suffer - good, it means you are growing.
  * Comfort is death - get out of comfort. Comfort means you do not have stretched goals to grow to change the world. Do not waste life in comfort as you decided to be start-upper if you are reading it.
  * Use any second of your life for your mission of innovator. You have meaningful time with your relatives and friends helpful to achieve the mission. Isn’t it?
* Top World Talent at Every Role
  * Rase the bar with any hire. Newcomers must be better than we are today, so we become greater tomorrow.
  * Everyone is responsible for hiring. Managers are promoted based on their ability to attract and develop top talent.
  * We embrace tough love: give and get real feedback to grow.
  * We are radically conscious and make an effort to comprehend deeply counterintuitive innovations. Those who rest on astrology and metaphysics would not find comfort here.
  * Never waste time. If we go to a date, we learn or build something moving forward to our mission and are open about it. When we walk or work out we listen to audiobooks of Titans.
* Always Learn, especially From Failures, Enemies and Titans
* Mistake is ok if used for learning. Hiding mistakes is a crime. We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
* Double effort when failed. Learning how to get out of shit is the greatest one. Get shit done.
* Discover the root problem. Ask “why did it happen 4 times to get in-depth insight what should be fixed.
* We do not defend or excuse our ego. We focus on how to get things done. And protect our assets such as clients loyalty and success, culture and processes.
* Enemies and competitors are our best friends as they force us to learn complex things.
* Find a 10x better way to do things. Leverage weekend hackathons to find a no-code tool.
* Read the Books of Titans (legendary founders and investors, not info-businessmen).
* Create Feedback Loops
  * We do calls with clients and product testing.
  * Client success managers, QA, SMM and everybody post their insights from clients.
  * We vote to express our team opinion and react on important posts in Slack.
* Be Ethically and Radically Transparent and Direct
  * Grandma should understand your OKRs, tasks, and failures at first glance.
  * Stories must be “Who needs What because Why”.
  * Give open feedback. We do not hide our opinions and never backtalk. If we suffer from our openness - this mean we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up.
  * Prefer productive open conflict to find a great solution over tacit compromise over mediocracy.
  * Negative feedback in public is better than no feedback. Especially if one demonstrate negligence to the principles.
  * Never do backtalk or gossip. We share with others only what we would say if the other person was in the room. If we discuss a misalignment - it should be heard by the person or her supervisors as we want to correct it. Otherwise it is likely to be collusion against a teammate, and potentially against all teammates and clients. We stop and report backtalk.
  * We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
  * Keep confidential data under lock such as client personal data, salaries, bonuses, procedures related to security.
  * Report to supervisor and CEO if the Principles or Code of Ethics are violated or not working well

Today, LATOKEN is a top exchange with the largest in the world primary market for blockchain startups' digital assets with 150+ Initial Exchange Offerings. 

Modern Primary and secondary markets for equity and other assets manage the allocation of planetary resources: shape incentives, goals,  values, and culture of billions of people to maximize capitalization (future profits) of the economy.  The capital markets is a leapfrog in social evolution that resulted in a 50x boost of economic growth since the late 1800th from historical 0.06% to 3.5% pa. It is comparable to the emergence of a neural system communicating with cells via electric signals instead of slow chains of chemical reactions.

Venture Capital and startups are the spearhead of the capital markets and mankind's evolution. Fantastic ideas from books and movies once read in childhood are built into products and new life for people here. 

A fantastic idea turns into greater reality after hundreds of hypothesis tests to find a team-product-market-timing fit. This requires investments and at least 100x productivity to US average people and 2000x to the performance of people from countries with less developed cultural and legal infrastructure. Such productivity is achievable via constant growth driven by: feedback loops, an inflow of great talent and culture (focusing on clients by solving the free-rider, asymmetry of information, attribution error problems). 

The traditional way of fundraising via introductions of angels and VC fund managers was recently a better option for high-quality startups. So they did not go for IEOs. Coupled with a lack of regulation, this enforced the negative selection and a vicious circle: lack of investable startups - lack of qualified investors - lack of investable startups - lack of qualified investors. As a result of the infant stage of the market, we explicitly state in weekly emails mentioning listings, that we do not recommend for investments or give investment advice regarding startups listed on the platform. Startups are informed in order forms, that we do not market them to our users and that they should not expect successful fundraise just because they are listed. Initial Exchange Offering (crowdfunding/primary market) is given as a complementary feature for free to the secondary listing.

Coronavirus quarantines and shocks for economic activity cut high-quality startups from traditional VCs.  VCs are derisking and are dry of cash as can not call capital from Limited Partners.

Agile startups can rescue the economy with new products and ways of life in the era of the pandemic but they are cut from the capital and lay off teammates.

That is our opportunity to give them access to new types of  VC investors: top managers and high net worth individuals - those who have both money and expertise about client pains and tech.

VCTV, mix of Netflix and Bloomberg for VC entrepreneurs and investors, solves the problem of online roadshows needed to connect non-blockchain startups with non-blockchain investors. 

Internet is moving information. Blockchain is moving value and we empower people with it.

Why we do

I still treasure the memories of my childhood. Sunny forest, I am 12, my brother 14 and my mom gathering some wildberries to eat it with bread. Was that the only food for that week?  I was happy at the forest, but I was crying afterwards: Why my beloved parents, like many millions, lost their engineering jobs, and money in hyperinflation. Why they was tortured by their inability to buy food for me and my brother? 

That was the reason why I started to study economics, get to NES to figure out the economic freedom concept. In particular, my parents and 140+ millions Russians did not have a vital economic freedom: protected property rights on their money.

My parents’ money were stripped by the central bank. The bank printed money to lend to friends. Many of them massively bought dollars and assets, grilling hyperinflation of nearly 1000%. They would-sell some assets in a year with c.1000%  profit to return worthless rubles to the bank. They would do everything to keep his friend to reign the bank, so those who understands what is going on are too weak to push him out of the chair. The central banker was called the worst in history in the Economist. Yes, that is not likely to be that black and white, yet hope you got the concept.



Due to lack of property rights people deliver 20x below their potential  

Screenshot 2020-07-22 at 12.46.32.pngEF 2019 CHAPTER 4 CHARTS-2.png

If one has power which is not counterbalanced, the power will be predatory used to gain more power. If politician can gain power to devide society and arm her clients for wars to strip property - the war is immenent, civil or global. 

If property rights are weak, predators will come. Property redistribution fuels power of predators, which once may destroy the planet. Planet needs protected property rights to survive. The more people are stakeholders of the future - the better it will be.

Property rights normally works when in place:

1. Political competition 
2. Independent media
3. Independent courts
4. Independent central bank

This heavy political machine costs quarter of global product and works poorly in most of the countries.

Blockchain enforces property rights with consensus protocols instead of politics. It works worldwide for any internet user even if her lives in a civil war.

The planet needs a new financial system opening economic freedom to people and making them stakeholders of a better future.

The new financial system will be easy to access and use, as DeFi needs no intermediaries and political bureaucracies.

The new financial system gives:

* accounts as easy to open as in a social network, worldwide
* access to any assets transferable digitally
* new asset classes, now easy to put to the market
* exchange any asset
* no custody risk
* digital wallets to manage the above

The new financial system will make people aligned to build a better future as measured by Nasdaq index. Price signals from capital markets through layers of product, labor, education, and dating markets will navigate people to live lives with a greater impact and meaning.

Blockchain enforces property rights without an army and politics, thus better money and financial system were born.

LATOKEN	Visionary Doers	Objectives
Mission	LATOKEN’s mission is to put financial life at fingertips. So people can use money to build future and be stakeholders of it.



Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life. Money is energy. Send the energy to transform any corner of the earth.



We are doing it to free people’s potential with the economic freedom to own and manage assets and money free of bureaucracy and corruption. So people can access money for their health, education, productivity, assets, and investments to become stakeholders of mankind’s future. This economic freedom can be spread with the adoption of cryptocurrency and assets worldwide.

Vision	Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life.

Ideas into life

Why many great ideas never happen or barely adopted?

Ideas worth nothing, execution is the king say investors. People have to get through many hurdles to make ideas happen.

They still should heavy-lift fundraising, investing, and payments. Thus have little time and energy left for their ideas and products. As a result of the heavy pressure only 1 out of 100 000 startups get to IPO while many entrepreneurs end up homeless on San Francisco streets. They burn their scarce resources to relocate here for investments.



If you were not based near San Francisco, you had many times less chance to raise investments. “If you are far from the internet oligopolies to have lunches with their managers, how would you get acquired by them?”, “If you are not in US, how would we know that your financials would not be faked or bank account raided”, “How would customers pay you online if they do not have credit cards?” - a VC investor would wonder.



Imagine if anyone with an idea can invest or find investors or have customers everywhere the same day. We are to free peoples potential to bring next big things.



Imagine the future, where it does not matter where do you live, it does not matter if you have connections with authorities, if parents can invest into you or give technology and clients from their company. You are equally empowered to bring your idea into life. If your idea really may help other people, they will invest to make a try and what you will build will be available to everyone the same day.

Protect and transfer value

Why it takes more time to wire money abroad today than to fly to the moon and back 60 years ago?

Why do you pay 2-3% to process your transaction when you buy a coffee? Why would it cost a grocery shop profit margin to move some electrons from one data base into another?

Why in many countries a central banker or a politician may print money for her friends and steal your money with inflation (failing the inflation targeting)?



Today, the financial system is still based on heavy and costful layers of banks. Many of them leverage network effects, government relations and regulation to keep their monopoly margins. Do not take it wrong, we serve clients, not our ego to look better than older institutions. 2.5 bn people do not have any bank account, not because of bad habits of banks. The costs of local corruption, costs of clients credit risks exceed transaction revenues, making opening traditional bank offices worthless in many regions.

  * Prefer productive open conflict to find a great solution over tacit compromise over mediocracy.
  * Negative feedback in public is better than no feedback. Especially if one demonstrate negligence to the principles.
  * Never do backtalk or gossip. We share with others only what we would say if the other person was in the room. If we discuss a misalignment - it should be heard by the person or her supervisors as we want to correct it. Otherwise it is likely to be collusion against a teammate, and potentially against all teammates and clients. We stop and report backtalk.
  * We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
  * Keep confidential data under lock such as client personal data, salaries, bonuses, procedures related to security.
  * Report to supervisor and CEO if the Principles or Code of Ethics are violated or not working well

CEO

Message from Valentin Preobrazhenskiy, the CEO of LATOKEN


Dear Aspiring Champion,

Welcome to LATOKEN. If your life's mission is to leverage technology to change the world, and if you thrive on stepping out of your comfort zone to push boundaries, then you're in the right place. LATOKEN could be the perfect place for you.

In this journey, I see myself as a sports trainer. My role is to encourage you to exert extra effort, to hit sequential targets that lead us towards our grand mission. In return for your hard work and dedication, you will be rewarded with an Olympic prize - stock options that you can cash out during an IPO or M&A.

At LATOKEN, we cultivate a sports culture and work together to build an inclusive future. Our aim is to make it easy for everyone to join the global brain of investors and become stakeholders of the future. We leverage WEB3 and AI to simplify the discovery of any assets, making it as straightforward as having a conversation with Chat GPT or receiving Amazon's advice on relevant goods. This approach will help people understand how the world works and choose a path to make an impact.

My journey into understanding the bigger picture began in my early childhood. I realized that my parents, despite being well-educated engineers, struggled to provide food for their children. This sparked my interest in economics, leading me to win regional Olympiads in the subject. A decade later, I launched the Global Education program, which has since provided over 770 scholarships for master's degrees abroad.

This is the root cause of why I founded LATOKEN.  Why we do 

Welcome to join and building the future together,

Valentin

PS. Apply for a vacancy and punch through the interviews.

BIO



Valentin, before founding LATOKEN, was a serial entrepreneur, tech ecosystem builder and hedge fund manager.  

He began his journey at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, where he worked as an energy strategy consultant. His interest in financial markets led him to hedge funds, where he managed a relative value strategy for energy equities. He rose to the position of Director at Marcuard Spectrum, a hedge fund with over $180 million in its portfolio (part of the Marcuard group with $3bn+ AUM). He founded Avega Capital hedge fund.

Driven by his passion for technology, Valentin transitioned into the tech startup ecosystem. He served as a Director at the Founder Institute, a leading global tech incubator with over $20B in alumni company value. He also launched three startups, one of which was a home equity loan platform that he successfully exited.

Valentin is a prolific tech ecosystem builder, having hosted over 700 meetups. He contributes to Web3 eductaion as a 20x keynote speaker, and with LATOKEN forums attended by two presidents. 

Valentin educates professionals and entrepreneurs to build tech unicorns. In his #nackedmanagement publications he emphasises that the main reason for startups to exist is the higher transparency due to smaller size and higher stocks options which both help to solve the principal-agent problem and develop sports culture. Otherwise startups should not exist as legacy giants has vast user base with less acquisition costs for new products, and higher pile of resourses.

Valentin shares his insights, which are a nexus of economics, game theory, and practical learnings from his startups and interactions with thousands of founders at his tech ecosystem meetups. He illustrates culture as a Nash stable solution to the Principal - Agent problem.    

His mission is to empower people to bring their ideas to life and make them stakeholders of the future they build. He believes this is achievable if people have access to money and assets, protected property rights, and free markets. To achieve this mission, Valentin leverages blockchain technology, which enforces property rights without the need for political force, courts, or central banks.

Valentin's world model is based on several key principles:

* The goal of life is its viability, which can be measured as the global economy capitalization (future output).
* Capitalization is driven by the  global brain of investors who optimize resource allocation by investing in prospective tech and cultures.
* Economic selection, coupled with price signal transmission from capital markets to products, labor, education, and dating markets, optimizes people's goals, values, and future output.
* Price transmission works if property rights are protected and markets are free to access.
* The more people think about and have stakes in the future, the better it will be. Thus, trading should be widespread.
* A successful startup is a rare mutation in culture and product that will spread and become the future.
* Joining a startup with an ambition to change the world means joining an Olympic team - it requires forgetting about a normal life and culture of comfort and embracing exceptional effort.

Valentin also wants to clarify some common misconceptions:

* Only 1 out of 10,000 startup attempts are successful and grow to become unicorns.
* Start-uppers are either unemployable down-shifters or champions.
* Traders are either uninformed gamblers or planetary managers.
* The internet transfers information, while blockchain transfers value.

One of Valentin's main personal objectives is to build a culture and a team that can shift frontiers to build the future. He calls this the "Visionary Champions Culture", which is characterized by:

* Putting clients first and ego last.
* Demanding exceptional performance from oneself and teammates.
* Removing bad apples and free riders to attract achievers.
* Giving and receiving brutally candid feedback and eliminating talking behind backs.
* Aligning one's life and daily tasks to achieve the mission.

The economic freedom

I still treasure the memories of my childhood. Sunny forest, I am 11, my brother 13 and my mom gathering some wildberries to eat it with bread. Was that the only food for that week? I was happy at the forest, but I was crying afterwards: Why my beloved parents lost their engineering jobs, and money in hyperinflation. Why they was tortured by their inability to buy food for me and my brother? 

That was the reason why I started to study economics and figure out the economic freedom concept. In particular, my parents and 140+ millions Russians did not have a vital economic freedom: protected property rights on their money.

My parents’ money were stripped by the central bank. The bank printed money to lend to friends. Many of them massively bought dollars and assets, grilling hyperinflation of nearly 1000%. They would-sell some assets in a year with c.1000%  profit to return worthless rubles to the bank. They would do everything to keep his friend to reign the bank, so those who understands what is going on are too weak to push him out of the chair. The central banker was called the worst in history in the Economist.

Today, LATOKEN is a top exchange with the largest in the world primary market for blockchain startups' digital assets with 150+ Initial Exchange Offerings. 

Modern Primary and secondary markets for equity and other assets manage the allocation of planetary resources: shape incentives, goals,  values, and culture of billions of people to maximize capitalization (future profits) of the economy.  The capital markets is a leapfrog in social evolution that resulted in a 50x boost of economic growth since the late 1800th from historical 0.06% to 3.5% pa. It is comparable to the emergence of a neural system communicating with cells via electric signals instead of slow chains of chemical reactions.

Venture Capital and startups are the spearhead of the capital markets and mankind's evolution. Fantastic ideas from books and movies once read in childhood are built into products and new life for people here. 

A fantastic idea turns into greater reality after hundreds of hypothesis tests to find a team-product-market-timing fit. This requires investments and at least 100x productivity to US average people and 2000x to the performance of people from countries with less developed cultural and legal infrastructure. Such productivity is achievable via constant growth driven by: feedback loops, an inflow of great talent and culture (focusing on clients by solving the free-rider, asymmetry of information, attribution error problems). 

The traditional way of fundraising via introductions of angels and VC fund managers was recently a better option for high-quality startups. So they did not go for IEOs. Coupled with a lack of regulation, this enforced the negative selection and a vicious circle: lack of investable startups - lack of qualified investors - lack of investable startups - lack of qualified investors. As a result of the infant stage of the market, we explicitly state in weekly emails mentioning listings, that we do not recommend for investments or give investment advice regarding startups listed on the platform. Startups are informed in order forms, that we do not market them to our users and that they should not expect successful fundraise just because they are listed. Initial Exchange Offering (crowdfunding/primary market) is given as a complementary feature for free to the secondary listing.

Coronavirus quarantines and shocks for economic activity cut high-quality startups from traditional VCs.  VCs are derisking and are dry of cash as can not call capital from Limited Partners.

Agile startups can rescue the economy with new products and ways of life in the era of the pandemic but they are cut from the capital and lay off teammates.

That is our opportunity to give them access to new types of  VC investors: top managers and high net worth individuals - those who have both money and expertise about client pains and tech.

VCTV, mix of Netflix and Bloomberg for VC entrepreneurs and investors, solves the problem of online roadshows needed to connect non-blockchain startups with non-blockchain investors. 

Internet is moving information. Blockchain is moving value and we empower people with it.

If you are a great fit and we do our job really well, you should earn 10-1000x of your any other next job market option. 

We allocate 20% of company shares to the team. That is 200% of the industry average for Series B SAAS or Fintech companies accordingly to Carta.

Why do we overpay with stocks to Principals?

As Andreessen puts it: “New companies generally should not exist. As existing companies have pretty happy clients, teams, and resources. Startups should punch through status quo.” This means exceptional results of the team, unseen by well established companies. 

Why startups may over perform advantages of well established companies?

- Because principals beat agents.

Startups smaller team size helps to make teammates performance transparent and startups can reward with greater stocks upside. These are two powerful tools to solve the Principal-agent and Free rider problems. 

“Stock Options is a recommendation straight out of something called “agency theory”, that says that you have to align the interests of the people managing the firm with the interests of its shareholders. 

Otherwise, they will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful... ” Freek Vermeulen @ Harvard Business Review 2009

I would add that team “will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful..” because top performers or principals would be wiped out by agents. Stocks empower principals and discourage agents. Because principal’s utility function value future impact for clients, while agent prefer short term benefit of comfort and lack of responsibility.

Ask yourself, is your teammate value comfort and lack of responsibility today or her prefer to grow to benefit clients in the future. Or in monetary terms, is her value monthly pay check or stock options? In other words, does her put first ego or clients?

Decrease monthly pay-check to wipe out agents and overpay to principals with stocks



Still, some agents may both value equity and prefer Free rider strategy where others grow capitalisation while her is blurring her underperformance. Ambiguity of innovation undermines performance transparency despite of smaller team benefits. Startups create new professions which have no performance benchmarks or direct metrics to measure her performance. Is her task really doable? 

This mean an agent can mislead others with her actual results or find excuses why desirable results are impossible. If such teammate earn the same stock options while making less investment with effort, than why would other teammates pursue a different strategy? Effort now seems as a loosing strategy to Free riding strategy. Effort is not a Nash stable strategy anymore. 

Furthermore, transparency will decline with acceleration when cooperation to cover each other give additional  advantage. Team will sneak to adequate performance killing startup’s advantage over legacy companies to seize marketshare. Stock value is nothing now. Remaining principals quit.  

Be the principal and force agents out

Agents cover each other when they know details of execution unknown to principals. They leverage asymmetry of information to benefit themselves at expense of principals. That is the definition of an agent. Asymmetry of information is the root cause of the principal-agent problem.

If you react on weak performance, misleading statements, excuses - you are likely to be principal.  Other principals are interested to reward you with greater stock bonus if you will increase value of all stocks. Principals are interested to push agents out and redistribute their unvested stocks between remaining or new-coming principals. At the same time founder and investors can not get stocks of pushed out agents as team stock pool is fixed at 20%. So they have no other interest then to maximize stocks value by oprimizing team pool between principals. The team of principals have even stronger incentives to push agents out as they get both stocks value growth and get more stocks (of pushed out agents). 

Principals are the main LATOKEN asset. Principals are your main asset as you are a stakeholder of LATOKEN. Remove asymmetries of information and agents. Do not tolerate lack of effort and adequate performance. Give brutal open feedback. Grow as a Principal!

To sum up, we overpay to encourage those who:  

* challenge lack of transparency and performance or excuse seeking
* hire and grow leaders who are stronger than herself
* lead hackathons and grow over weekends
* volunteer as a scrum master
* show initiatives outside of your current scope, after you really done your job greatly

 If you do the above and not feel overpaid - tell to supervisor or ceo

Factor in growth

In startup land, the company you pick is more important than everything else: it’s more important than the role, it’s more important than your salary, and it’s more important than the projected value of your equity grant. Look at the guy who painted the walls on the original Facebook office. As Eric Schmidt told Sheryl Sandberg when she was considering joining Google, “if you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on—don’t ask what seat.”

Career Review

Why Big3 alumni lead Fortune 500 legacy companies, not tech companies, and earn 10-100x less than tech CEOs?

First, after the dot-com bubble tech job was taboo for Big 3 alumni. The consultancy business model is based on the firm brand reputation, so hard workers are selected and taught to avoid anything risky for the firm brand. The dot-com crash scandals of tech investors and founders committing suicide were a no go for risk-averse big 3 alumni.  

Second, tech companies' agile culture leaves little space for the value of external consultants. Thus big3 advise mostly legacy clients in the US.

Third, structuring and hardworking is not enough. Tech needs creativity and making working products, rather than rock-solid,  world proved and well-explained advice.

In the US in 2000x the emergence of private equity and later hedge funds stripped talent from consultancy. In 2010th startups eclipsed hedge funds as the top talent destination. Over the last decade, top startup CEOs earned 10x to top hedge funds CEOs. Top hedge fund CEOs earned 10x comparing to CEOs of legacies like consumer retail offline or banks.

In Russia stagnating capital markets and flee of capital markets firms to London left Big3 as the mainstream destination for top talent. Big3 strive to maintain standards by rotating consultants btw international offices, however, culture adapts to the local market. The last scandal on the restrictions on the firm teammates' political rights is a good example. 

The shrinking private market and growing state business mean a growing pressure for politically-driven culture and slides. 

The strong HR brand still means inflow of talent density to be educated pretty the same and the same basic operations or state strategic slides disconnected with the future market needs. This means the less future value of such experience on the job market. I bet most of the product managers in HH or Yandex, are growing their future value relatively faster (while standards are more volatile in this professional segment).  

Some champions dare to get into the new tech rocket ships - they will build the future. 

Thoughts?

PS. Btw Harvard, Yale invested in digital gold BTC. Crypto is not a taboo anymore like porn driven internet was. Blockchain startups will worth $50+ trillion as they cut the cost of political systems to enforce property rights. Property rights coupled with market competition are fundamental for modern incentive structure and the reason for economic growth.

Do not listen to your risk averse friends advising state legacy. Be openminded. Think big.  You were born to change the world, not to meet the expectations of parents or friends. Get into a rocket.

Investors vs. Employees

* February 23, 2017
* Henry Ward

 

When I arrived in Silicon Valley in 2010, I was told standard employee option pools were 15% of the post-money fully diluted. A couple of years later, I was told the standard was 12%. Now I hear 10%. It feels like employee option pool sizes are decreasing and the Carta data backs this up.

2021-09-28_19-04-44.png

Average option pool percentages by round and year (Carta data)

Equity allocation is a zero-sum game between investors and employees.

Equity-hungry investors buy equity while equity-hungry employees earn it. Both care deeply about every point of equity but for different reasons.

Investors care about equity because it’s their business model. While CEOs have discretionary authority to spend millions of dollars of operating capital, issuing one option grant worth $0.10 requires Board approval. This is how important equity ownership is in the venture capital business model. Employees care about equity because of scarcity — there’s little to go around so every bit counts.

CEO/Founders tend to be equity-neutral in cap table negotiations. Their ownership stake is set at founding and rarely changes. And the relative size and cost basis of their ownership means small changes in the cap table become rounding errors in their personal economics.

The CEO negotiates term sheets with investors and offer letters with employees. But they are a middleman without a personal stake in the equity allocation decision. Investors and employees mistakenly believe they’re competing with the CEO for equity because that is who they negotiate with. But economically they are competing with each other. This undercurrent is the single most misunderstood driver of tension on the cap table.

Employee ownership is decreasing because these equity decisions are made in board meetings, where investors have a seat and employees don’t.

Last October we did an analysis of how Carta employee ownership compared to 10 randomly chosen Series B SAAS or Fintech companies. Below are the high-level results. A great question for employees evaluating startups is to ask how much of the company is already employee owned.

The capital markets optimize the allocation of planetary resources to maximize return on investments which means maximize capitalization.  It shapes the incentives, goals,  values, and culture of billions of people to maximize capitalization (future profits) of the economy.  The capital markets is a leapfrog in social evolution that resulted in a 50x boost of economic growth since the late 1800th from historical 0.06% to 3.5% pa. It is comparable to the emergence of a neural system communicating with cells via electric signals instead of slow chains of chemical reactions.

The modern global machine is mainly built on protected property rights and free markets, enforced by political machines based on competition between politicians and media to get the majority vote. These mean market economy where incentives are delivered via prices through interrelated markets. Price contagion or price transmission from capital markets across assets into product, labor, education and even dating markets optimize incentives for billions of people to feel and do something useful for capitalization.

Venture Capital and startups are the spearhead of the capital markets and mankind evolution. Fantastic ideas from books and movies once read in childhood are built into products and new life for people here. 

Both prosperity and recession have roots n the capital markets (except covid perhaps). Errors of traders destroy billions and institutions built for centuries.

Yes, you are getting it right: capital markets jobs are about exceptional accuracy, performance, creativity and discipline.

Goal of Life

Life is an execution of a program using energy to build storage and other infrastructure for itself out of entropy. Programs that use energy poorly are erased by natural and economical selection in competition for limited sources of energy (such as clients’ money). Thus the goal of the program is to use energy in a way that will enable it to use more energy in the future. Simply because  programs with other goals are erased by programs with this goal. That is not necessary about conscious  goal, programs can have none or little consciousness. 

Energy is about calories burnt in brains, muscles, engines to manage entropy, eg to build and deliver goods. Thus money is a medium of energy. Each payment triggers burn out of energy to build and deliver goods and services. The monetary equivalent of energy spend due to payments each year is c.$90tn - Gross Global Product. Future money or energy spent is capitalization. 

Now you know that you are a part of the program evolving to maximize capitalization. Your program is your DNA, some knowledge, and most of all values or culture. Add some proteins (built as encoded in your DNA), your connections (build as encoded in your culture) and you have your machine which is a part of a larger machine which has a goal to maximize capitalization. If you help the machine it will likely reward you. If you make impediments, the immune system should work out (otherwise the machine will lose to a healthier machine).

Protect human rights

Human Rights are:

* Life
* Property
* Free Trade



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ynjVw1K5WA

Nobel Prize 1993, Douglas North

Enforce human rights or people will kill competitors and seize their property instead of making better products and lowering prices.

https://youtu.be/A2xhmlpUKd8?t=1830

Political machines costs quarter of the global economy

Political machines are system of powers defining who shape and enforce the rules for nations.
Their design may vary from civil war, stationary bandit, kleptocracy or to democracy. Most of the democracies are likely to protect the human rights enabling free markets and result in output per capita higher by magnitude. 

Most of the democracies evolved to have 4 mechanisms:

1. Political competition 
  * Are there political competitors fighting for a median vote? 
  * Can a populist win election by offering property redistribution?
  * Can politicians kill one another?

2. Independent media

  * Can incumbent politician ask media to hide investigations done by his political competitors? 

3. Independent courts

  * Can a politician ask courts to help him to seize property from less loyal to more loyal?  

4. Independent central bank

  * Can a politician ask central bank to print money to buy votes or guns?
  * Can a politician or banker bribe or kill a central banker to avoid capital adequacy requirement or investigation of washing bribes?



Blockchain enforces property rights without the political machines and thus unlock free markets across the world to produce a quadrillion value.


Make Stakeholders

https://youtu.be/axWt4HVT7iY?t=25

If people are stakeholders of the future, they are aligned to make it better. 

If they are not the stakeholders, they might prefer to destroy it. 

Natural and economic selection are the tough evolutionary force. The force imply a conflict to determine which  of the few innovations will be spread, and which of the cultures and even countries will fade away. Would this conflict turn into a doomsday if a deadly technology becomes widely available?

Humankind needs everybody to be stakeholders of the better future to ensure technology is not used against itself. If one is not the winner, he is still stakeholder. If one is not a stakeholder by a mistake, there are should be plenty of people around who have an opportunity and thus motivated to take care about this person. If it is a dictator who have a better chance to save his chair and life with the help of terrorism, there should be stakeholders around who want to change her mind. If it is an angry Joker there should be stakeholders around to help her to ease the conflict and give an opportunity.



No one can stop the spread of technology for a long time, however one can cut equal opportunity and the future. Blockchain can not be stopped.

There are looters and those who want to protect the human rights of the looters, while keeping them accountable for violations of the human rights.

Do looters feel unequal opportunity and their rights violated to have excuse to steal property? What if they have a mass distraction weapon at their hand? That is a pretty hard complexity we should learn to manage together.

The Economic Freedom



I still treasure the memories of my childhood. Sunny forest, I am 12, my brother 14 and my mom gathering some wildberries to eat it with bread. Was that the only food for that week? I was happy at the forest, but I was crying afterwards: Why my beloved parents lost their engineering jobs, and money in hyperinflation. Why they were tortured by their inability to buy food for me and my brother? 

That was the reason why I started to study economics and figure out the economic freedom concept. In particular, my parents and 140+ millions Russians did not have a vital economic freedom: protected property rights on their money.

My parents’ money were stripped by the central bank. The bank printed money to lend to central banker friends. Many of them massively bought dollars and assets, grilling hyperinflation of nearly 1000%. They would-sell some assets in a year with c.1000%  profit to return worthless rubles to the bank. They would do everything to keep his friend to reign the bank, so those who understands what is going on are too weak to push him out of the chair. The central banker was called the worst in history in the Economist.

Goal of life - share in Nasdaq index

1. Life will use all energy and matter to build home for life.

Life is program which use energy to selfreplicate.

Life DNA and culture, a layer 3 and above protocol on top of layer 2 - proteins and assets which are on top of layer 1 - energy and money. It is like DeFi layer 2 on top of blockchain layer 1.



Screenshot 2021-07-25 at 22.16.29.png

Life will not stop untill all energy and matter is used to build home for life. Why? 

Because it evolves in competition with other forms of life for energy sources (share in food niches or market). Eg. use energy better to get more energy under management or loose in competition and die.  Natural and economic selection is strongly biased to DNA (in the past) and cultures (today), ML (tomorrow) maximizing efficiency of energy use to sustain itself in the future. 

2. Future energy under management = future earnings or global cap

Modern macro organism on earth is maximizing future energy under management via price transmission through markets:

1. Investors move money today to assets which will earn more money tomorrow. Money is a store and mean of exchange of manageable calories used in muscules, brains, computing power and engines.  
2. Change on stocks market prices changes prices on product, labour, education and even dating markets . 
3. Thus people make decisions today which help investors to earn more money tomorrow.

By doing the above, I will build the culture of “Olympic Freedom and Responsibility for the mission driven critical hits“

Culture is not something what we have in our hearts. It is not a set of our beliefs. Culture is a set of actions. Who you are is what you do. Culture is how and which decisions are made, especially if no one sees.



We have beliefs and Principles and we will do everything to make them working. We leverage shocking rules to make it clear.

For example, if one is not following the Rule to be the client of the product her is building - her would not be able to build it.





A better culture is the reason for unicorns

Generally, new companies should not exist. The only reason is their new culture which can solve creativity paradoxes to punch through legacy players.

Culture is born in the war of economic selection. Culture is the war between the past and the future. Once a greater culture is born, it erases cultures of the past. Past cultures strive to survive and thus the war is imminent and intence as culturicide erases way more information than genocide. 

We do not smell this war with rooten flash on the streets as the war is now on the markets. Cultures compete for clients via products and prices instead of guns. Thus the war is now global and ligtning fast. 

Evolve culture lightning fast or die. That is evolution.

AI Operations (Python, React.js)
The Product Developer in AI Operations role involves leveraging Python, React.js, or no-code tools to automate processes across HR, Customer Success, and Task Management. This position offers the unique advantage of achieving targets more rapidly and transparently since your clients are also your colleagues.
This role firs a character willing to roll sleeves and do operational job by his hands to pinpoint improvement opportunities through automation. For instance, you might assume the role of a customer support manager, interacting directly with clients for a week to identify routine tasks that can be transferred to a language model or algorithm.
The ideal candidate will have prior hands-on experience in operational domains, such as Sales or Marketing, and is either transitioning into a development career or aspiring to climb to a COO or another C-level role, enriched with technical proficiency.

In this position, you will innovate and enhance the effectiveness of marketing strategies such as airdrops, giveaways, and trading competitions, and automate other marketing channels. Your responsibilities will include filtering out bot farms to ensure efficient budget use, designing new types of rewards, such as those for social media influence, and testing marketing activities to gather user feedback. 
This role is heavily data-driven, focusing on reducing Client Acquisition Costs, improving conversions and virality metrics, and analyzing social and on-chain data to prioritize token partnerships for growth activities. You will also work towards making the performance of growth managers transparent, ensuring that best practices are rewarded and less effective strategies are phased out.
The ideal candidate should have experience developing Telegram bots, implementing gamification, or participating in Airdrops. While technical skills and experience are valued, we place a higher emphasis on character, which we believe is the essential foundation for acquiring and enhancing professional skills.


Token Discovery Data (Python, PostgreSQL or DWH)

You will simplify the access to detailed insights from on-chain data, social media mentions, and news, providing a deep understanding of each asset's potential. Furthermore, you will educate stakeholders about the technology, business potential, market dynamics, and even global macroeconomic trends. This educational aspect is vital for democratizing the capital markets, as increasing the number of informed stakeholders can help shape a better future.
Your duties will involve aggregating and cleaning data to ensure its usability across various services. Tasks may include integrating new blockchain explorers, connecting with data aggregators, or extracting information from social media and news platforms.
The ideal candidate will possess an analytical mindset and have robust experience with databases and Python. This position requires a candidate who can handle complex data with precision and translate technical information into actionable insights for investors.

Your responsibilities will include implementing recommendation systems similar to those used by Amazon, where user interests are analyzed to display the most relevant and promising assets. Additionally, you will ensure that users receive timely notifications about market events and news that are crucial for informed trading decisions.
The core challenge of this role is to design interfaces that handle complex data yet remain simple and intuitive for users. 
This is a product-intensive role that demands rigorous testing of the features you develop, assessing their impact on user engagement metrics such as retention.
You will be fully responsible for the features you develop, coordinating with backend teams and other departments to overcome any obstacles that arise during development.
The ideal candidate is someone with a keen interest in trading—not gambling—who takes ownership of their work, tests thoroughly, and uses the products they develop. This role requires a proactive, dedicated individual who is committed to enhancing user experience and driving product success.
Backend (Java)
As a Backend Product Developer specializing in Java, you will play a crucial role in collaborating with multiple product development teams to facilitate the launch of new services. Your responsibilities will involve leveraging our microservice architecture to ensure that services are both reusable and maintainable while maintaining their independence and efficiency.
You may also handle high-load tasks, such as scaling the throughput of our exchange’s matching engine or reducing the order roundtrip latency, which are critical for improving performance and user experience.
The ideal candidate will have an outstanding academic record, holding a top GPA from a leading technical university in their region. This educational background is essential as it ensures a well-organized, top-down systemic approach to problem-solving. Additionally, candidates should have at least two years of experience with Java. This role is suited for someone who is technically proficient and adept at thinking through complex systems to deliver robust backend solutions.
Trading (C#)

This ensures that traders can efficiently exchange assets with minimal slippage. Additionally, you will fortify the trading desk's capital by developing robust risk management systems designed to prevent directional bets and guard against potential arbitrage or manipulation.
Your responsibilities will extend to aggregating liquidity across both centralized and decentralized exchanges, ensuring that Latoken provides the best liquidity and prices for the widest variety of assets. This is crucial for maintaining our status as the premier marketplace for altcoins. 
You will integrate new exchanges, implement smart order routing, and refine strategies for market-making assets that are not listed elsewhere. Furthermore, you will work to secure top positions in exchange ranking sites, enhancing our attractiveness to both traders and tokens considering listing with us.
The ideal candidate understands that accurate pricing acts as the nervous system of the global economy. This role requires someone with practical trading experience and likely a background in quantitative finance or high-frequency trading (HFT). The candidate should be proficient to use stress for rapid problemsolving.

Operations Developer

As an Operations Developer, your role will involve hands-on management of various operational tasks, with a primary focus on enhancing efficiency through automation. You will play an active role in areas such as the Call Center, Customer Support, and CRM automation. Initially, you will directly engage in these operations, gaining a deep understanding of the processes. Following this, you will transition to automating these systems, and subsequently move on to execute, identify and transform other operational routines that have not yet been automated.  

This role offers significant career advancement opportunities. Within 3-6 months, you could be promoted to a Product Developer in AI Operations or choose to specialize in a specific unit and progress to become an Operations Executive.

We prioritize hiring individuals who are eager to code and innovate, rather than those who prefer routine tasks. This approach ensures motivation to develop automation solutions and move away from the status quo.

This position is ideal for those with an operational background who have begun learning coding due to a desire to shift their career towards development, or for those looking to leverage technology to advance to executive levels.

Продуктовый разработчик

Разработчики продуктов полностью берут на себя ответственность за проекты или функции, преодолевая любые препятствия, чтобы обеспечить доставку в производство и добавить измеримую ценность для клиентов. Они также требуют отчетности от членов команды, удаляя тех, кто не берет на себя ответственность или ищет оправдания.

AI операции (Python, React.js)
Роль Product Developer в области AI Operations включает использование Python, React.js или инструментов no-code  для автоматизации процессов в HR, Customer Success и управлении задачами. Эта позиция предлагает уникальное преимущество достижения целей быстрее и прозрачнее, так как ваши клиенты также являются вашими коллегами.
Эта роль подходит для человека, готового засучить рукава и выполнять операционную работу своими руками, чтобы выявлять возможности для улучшения через автоматизацию. Например, вы можете взять на себя роль менеджера по поддержке клиентов, взаимодействуя напрямую с клиентами в течение недели, чтобы определить рутинные задачи, которые можно передать языковой модели или алгоритму.
Идеальный кандидат будет иметь практический опыт в операционных областях, таких как продажи или маркетинг, и либо переходить в карьеру разработчика, либо стремиться подняться до уровня COO или другой руководящей должности, обогащенной техническими навыками.
Growth(Python, Node.js)
Как Product Developer Growth, специализирующийся на Python и Node.js, ваша роль будет ключевой в обеспечении стартапов с токенами возможностью использовать свои токены для финансирования маркетинговых инициатив, направленных на привлечение новых пользователей. Кроме того, вы будете помогать криптоэнтузиастам узнавать о новых технологиях и получать вознаграждения за их усилия по продвижению принятия.
В этой должности вы будете разрабатывать и улучшать эффективность маркетинговых стратегий, таких как airdrop-кампании, розыгрыши и торговые конкурсы, а также автоматизировать другие маркетинговые каналы. Ваши обязанности будут включать фильтрацию бот-ферм для обеспечения эффективного использования бюджета, разработку новых типов вознаграждений, таких как вознаграждения за влияние в социальных сетях, и тестирование маркетинговых активностей для сбора отзывов пользователей.
Эта роль сильно ориентирована на данные, с акцентом на снижение затрат на привлечение клиентов, улучшение показателей конверсии и виральности, а также анализ социальных и on-chain данных для приоритизации токен-партнерств для роста. Вы также будете работать над обеспечением прозрачности работы менеджеров по росту, гарантируя, что лучшие практики вознаграждаются, а менее эффективные стратегии устраняются.
Идеальный кандидат должен иметь опыт разработки ботов для Telegram, внедрения элементов геймификации или участия в Airdrop-кампаниях. Хотя технические навыки и опыт важны, мы придаем большее значение характеру, который, по нашему мнению, является основной основой для приобретения и улучшения профессиональных навыков.

Кроме того, вы будете обучать заинтересованные стороны технологиям, бизнес-потенциалу, динамике рынка и даже глобальным макроэкономическим трендам. Этот образовательный аспект жизненно важен для демократизации рынков капитала, так как увеличение числа информированных участников может помочь сформировать лучшее будущее.
Ваши обязанности будут включать агрегацию и очистку данных для обеспечения их пригодности для использования в различных сервисах. Задачи могут включать интеграцию новых блокчейн-эксплореров, подключение к агрегаторам данных или извлечение информации из социальных сетей и новостных платформ.
Идеальный кандидат будет обладать аналитическим складом ума и иметь солидный опыт работы с базами данных и Python. Эта должность требует кандидата, который способен точно обрабатывать сложные данные и переводить техническую информацию в практические инсайты для инвесторов.

Как Product Developer, специализирующийся на интерфейсах для обнаружения токенов (один из: Web (React.js), Android и iOS), вы будете играть ключевую роль в создании удобных цифровых платформ, которые облегчают международной аудитории процесс обнаружения новых активов.
Ваши обязанности будут включать внедрение рекомендательных систем, аналогичных тем, которые используются Amazon, где анализируются интересы пользователей для отображения наиболее релевантных и перспективных активов. Кроме того, вы будете обеспечивать, чтобы пользователи своевременно получали уведомления о рыночных событиях и новостях, которые важны для принятия обоснованных торговых решений.
Основной задачей этой роли является разработка интерфейсов, которые обрабатывают сложные данные, но при этом остаются простыми и интуитивно понятными для пользователей. 
Эта роль связана с интенсивной работой над продуктом и требует тщательного тестирования разрабатываемых функций, а также оценки их влияния на показатели вовлеченности пользователей, такие как удержание.
Вы будете полностью ответственны за разрабатываемые функции, координируя работу с командами backend и другими отделами для преодоления любых препятствий, возникающих в процессе разработки.
Идеальный кандидат — это человек с живым интересом к трейдингу, а не азартным играм, который берет на себя ответственность за свою работу, тщательно тестирует её и использует разрабатываемые продукты. Эта роль требует проактивного и преданного своему делу человека, который стремится улучшить пользовательский опыт и способствовать успеху продукта.
Backend (Java)
Как Backend-разработчик, специализирующийся на Java, вы будете играть ключевую роль в сотрудничестве с несколькими командами по разработке продуктов для содействия запуску новых сервисов. Ваши обязанности будут включать использование нашей микросервисной архитектуры для обеспечения того, чтобы сервисы были как повторно используемыми и поддерживаемыми, так и независимыми и эффективными.
Вам также может потребоваться решать задачи с высокой нагрузкой, такие как увеличение пропускной способности нашего движка сопоставления на бирже или снижение задержки обработки заказов, что является критически важным для улучшения производительности и пользовательского опыта.
Идеальный кандидат должен иметь выдающийся академический рекорд, обладая высоким средним баллом от ведущего технического университета в своем регионе. Такое образовательное прошлое важно, так как оно гарантирует хорошо организованный, системный подход к решению проблем. Кроме того, кандидаты должны иметь как минимум два года опыта работы с Java. Эта роль подходит для человека, который технически подкован и умеет мыслить системно, чтобы предоставлять надежные backend-решения.
Трейдинг (C#)
Как Product Developer в области трейдинга с опытом на C#, ваша роль заключается в том, чтобы оживить развивающиеся рынки капитала, улучшая ликвидность в ордербуках. Это гарантирует, что трейдеры смогут эффективно обменивать активы с минимальным проскальзыванием. Кроме того, вы укрепите капитал Trading Desk, разрабатывая надежные системы управления рисками, предназначенные для предотвращения направленных ставок и защиты от потенциального арбитража или манипуляций.
Ваши обязанности будут включать агрегацию ликвидности как на централизованных, так и на децентрализованных биржах, обеспечивая, что Latoken предоставляет лучшую ликвидность и цены для самого широкого ассортимента активов. Это критически важно для поддержания нашего статуса ведущей торговой площадки для альткоинов.
Вы будете интегрировать новые биржи, внедрять умные маршрутизации ордеров и совершенствовать стратегии маркетмейкинга для активов, не представленных на других площадках. Кроме того, вы будете работать над обеспечением топовых позиций на сайтах рейтингов бирж, повышая нашу привлекательность как для трейдеров, так и для токенов, рассматривающих возможность листинга у нас.
Идеальный кандидат понимает, что точное ценообразование действует как нервная система глобальной экономики. Эта роль требует человека с практическим опытом в трейдинге и, вероятно, с образованием в области количественных финансов или высокочастотной торговли (HFT). Кандидат должен быть способен использовать стресс для быстрого решения проблем.

Разработчик операций

В качестве операционного разработчика ваша роль будет включать непосредственное управление различными операционными задачами с основным упором на повышение эффективности через автоматизацию. Вы будете активно участвовать в таких областях, как Call Center, Customer Support и автоматизация CRM. На начальном этапе вы будете непосредственно вовлечены в эти операции, чтобы глубоко понять процессы. После этого вы перейдете к автоматизации этих систем, а затем будете выполнять, выявлять и преобразовывать другие операционные рутинные процессы, которые еще не были автоматизированы.

Эта роль предлагает значительные возможности для карьерного роста. В течение 3-6 месяцев вы можете быть повышены до разработчика продуктов в области AI Operations или выбрать специализацию в конкретном подразделении и продвинуться до должности операционного руководителя.

Мы отдаем приоритет найму людей, которые стремятся к программированию и инновациям, а не тех, кто предпочитает рутинные задачи. Такой подход обеспечивает мотивацию для разработки автоматизационных решений и отхода от существующего положения вещей.

Эта позиция идеально подходит для тех, кто имеет операционный опыт и начал изучать программирование из желания изменить свою карьеру в сторону разработки, или для тех, кто стремится использовать технологии для продвижения на руководящие должности.

Ваши ключевые обязанности будут включать мониторинг и контроль показателей продаж с помощью панели управления, которая подчеркивает доход или количество привлеченных трейдеров на одного менеджера, а также поддерживающие метрики, такие как коэффициенты конверсии, затраты на привлечение клиентов, время отклика, просроченные задачи и индекс удовлетворенности клиентов (NPS).
Вы будете контролировать обеспечение качества коммуникаций и гарантировать, что лидеры команд проводят эффективные тренинги, оснащенные хорошо подготовленными руководствами по адаптации, включающими сценарии, тесты и ролевые игры. Кроме того, вы будете следить за корректной работой всех систем и сотрудничать с разработчиками операционных процессов для поддержания прозрачности в рабочих процессах и решении проблем, а также защищать данные о клиентах и лидах от утечек.
Идеальный кандидат на эту должность должен иметь опыт работы с CRM и в области операционных продаж, а также способность поддерживать дисциплину среди команд продаж, чтобы они следовали установленным процессам. Вы должны уделять приоритетное внимание максимизации доходов от продаж при минимизации бюрократических препятствий, которые должны постоянно упрощаться с помощью автоматизации, чтобы команда продаж могла сосредоточиться на построении доверительных отношений с клиентами.
Менеджер продаж
Как менеджер по продажам для листинга на бирже Latoken, вы являетесь инвестиционным банкиром новой эры, продвигающим демократизацию рынков капитала через "IPO" передовых активов. Ваша основная роль заключается в построении крепких отношений с клиентами, понимании их потребностей и демонстрации того, как листинг на Latoken может помочь им справиться с проблемами, связанными с принятием и ростом токенов.
Ваши обязанности начинаются с интенсивной работы по поиску потенциальных клиентов, используя автоматизацию и продвинутые последовательности сообщений.

We overpay to great performers with stocks

If you are a great fit and we do our job really well, you should earn 10-1000x of your any other next job market option. 

We allocate 20% of company shares to the team. That is 200% of the industry average for Series B SAAS or Fintech companies accordingly to Carta.

Why do we overpay with stocks?

As Andreessen puts it: “New companies generally should not exist. As existing companies have pretty happy clients, teams, and resources. Startups should punch through status quo.” This means exceptional results of the team, unseen by well established companies. Why startups can be better?

Startups’ smaller team size helps to make teammates performance transparent and startups can reward with greater stocks upside. These are two powerful tools to solve the Principal-agent and Free rider problems. 

“Stock Options is a recommendation straight out of something called “agency theory”, that says that you have to align the interests of the people managing the firm with the interests of its shareholders. 

Otherwise, they will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful... ” Freek Vermeulen @ Harvard Business Review 2009

I would add that team “will only do things that are in their own interest, and will be inactive, lazy, or plain deceitful..” because top performers or principals would be wiped out by agents. Stocks empower principals and discourage agents. Because principal’s utility function value future impact for clients, while agent prefer short term benefit of comfort and lack of responsibility.

Ask yourself, is your teammate value comfort and lack of responsibility today or her prefer to grow to benefit clients in the future. Or in monetary terms, is her value monthly pay check or stock options? In other words, does her put clients first, ego last?

Agent will hire weaker people as is afraid of competitor for his position and salary. Principal will hire stronger candidate to maximize probability of the company to succeed which increase his stock payoff.

Decrease monthly pay-check to wipe out agents and overpay to principals with stocks



Still, some agents may both value equity and prefer Free rider strategy where others grow capitalization while her is blurring her underperformance. Ambiguity of innovation undermines startup's performance transparency despite of smaller team size. Startups create new professions which have no performance benchmarks or direct metrics to measure her performance. Is her task really doable? 

This mean an agent can mislead others with her actual results or find excuses why desirable results are impossible. If such teammate earn the same stock options while making less investment with effort, then why would other teammates pursue a different strategy? Effort now seems as a loosing strategy to Free riding strategy. Effort is not a Nash stable strategy anymore. 

Furthermore, transparency will decline with acceleration when cooperation to cover each other give additional  advantage. Team will sneak to adequate performance killing startup’s advantage over legacy companies to seize market share. Stock value is nothing now. Remaining principals quit.  

Be the principal and force agents out

Agents cover each other when they know details of execution unknown to principals. They leverage asymmetry of information to benefit themselves at expense of principals. That is the definition of an agent. Asymmetry of information is the root cause of the principal-agent problem (part of contract and mechanism design theories - 5 Nobel Awards in economics: Arrow 1972, Muskin 2006, Hart & Holmstrom 2016, Milgrom 2020) 

If you react on weak performance, misleading statements, excuses - you are likely to be principal.  Other principals are interested to reward you with greater stock bonus if you will increase value of all stocks. Principals are interested to push agents out and redistribute their unvested stocks between remaining or new-coming principals. At the same time founder and investors can not get stocks of pushed out agents as team stock pool is fixed at 20%. So they have no other interest then to maximize stocks value by optimizing team pool between principals. The team of principals have even stronger incentives to push agents out as they get both stocks value growth and get more stocks (of pushed out agents). 

Principals are the main LATOKEN asset. Principals are your main asset as you are a stakeholder of LATOKEN. Remove asymmetries of information and agents. Do not tolerate lack of effort and adequate performance. Give brutal open feedback. Grow as a Principal!

To sum up, we overpay to encourage those who:  

* challenge lack of transparency and performance or excuse seeking or fake work
* hire and grow leaders who are stronger than herself
* lead hackathons and grow over weekends
* volunteer as a scrum master
* show initiatives outside of your current scope, after you really done your job greatly

 If you do the above and do not feel overpaid - tell to supervisor or ceo

Factor in growth 

In startup land, the company you pick is more important than everything else: it’s more important than the role, it’s more important than your salary, and it’s more important than the projected value of your equity grant. Look at the guy who painted the walls on the original Facebook office. As Eric Schmidt told Sheryl Sandberg when she was considering joining Google, “if you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on—don’t ask what seat.”

Cut Cancer

1. Agent is a deadly cultural cancer - cut it before all organism is infected.

Cancer is a cell cheating on an organism when other cells fail to detect and stop it.  

Wars are not the main people’s killer, parasites are. The same about organisations - they shade away due to the infectious cancer culture of agents free-riders. Agents use a lack of transparency to cheat on Principals. Agent try to infect teammates around to lower standards and cover fake work of each other.

https://youtu.be/uoJwt9l-XhQ?si=9BlFg3flM5-oJ2rb



2. Cancer Agents use asymmetry of information to freeride Principals. 

An agent knows details of execution unknown to the principal and this assymetry of information may be used to freeride them. For example: Newly hired HR may blameshift lack of hires to negative attitude of candidates to crypto or to the company. The real reason could be zero attempts to contact candidates or poor quality of communication. If principals do not have capacity to check the number of contact attempts or check messages and calls records, than why not to freeride them?

So, again, teammates who work closely with him and know his actual workload have two options: ask him to leave the company or enjoy him as a bar lowerer so their weak performance now look relatively ok and they may cooperate to reinforce the excuses to lower the bar of a Nash stable strategy further. 

This decision is a differentiator between an Agent and a Principal. Make the right choice, once the wrong one is done, it starts to self-enforce and shape the future for yourself and for humankind.

Dr. Ringelmann found out that with a rope pulling team size growth to 8 average effort declines 50%. An exception is only when team consists of professional sportsmen (as free-riders are wiped out fast in sports).

Screenshot 2021-07-25 at 18.05.46.png

3. Challenge freeriding to make a hardworking Nash stable strategy

That is how you ensure no one can benefit with an alternative strategy, thus champion strategy is Nash stable.  

For example: A teammate uses the freeriding strategy in order to save some time and doesn’t make the task “grandma clear” in the SCRUM format “Who needs What for Why”. Saved time allows that teammate to do more tasks than other members of the team, so he may have a career advantage over teammates. Also teammates have less clarity about what he is doing so he may fake his work and do a side business to resell what his teammates produced.

If teammates ask him to make an effort to write an appropriate story and give him less score on 360, his benefit on time saving may be below loss in social currency. Thus, his strategy to save time on writing a proper story will have negative profit. Either he will go bankrupt or change her strategy to write a story in scrum format.

Small, yet powerful with the compound effect.

High Performance Culture  = Agents can not collude against Principals to hide freeriding as:



1. performance is transparent with OKRs, 360 and

2. most of the team are Principals who report freeriding as

3. most of the teammates are motivated by stocks and

4. their goal of life is to change the world with a product



Now you know the underlying theory for our layer 1 cultural protocol:

I commit to:

* Put clients first, ego last <= (4. their goal of life is to change the world with a product, 3. most of the teammates motivated by stocks)
* Demand exceptional performance from myself and teammates like olympic sportsmen principal  (2. most of the team are Principals who report freeriding)
* Give candid feedback and eliminate talking behind the back (2. most of team are Principals who report freeriding)
* Use any feedback to grow and never give up, never quit (imminent threat to existence drives evolution)

LATOKEN PRINCIPLES (RULES)

Culture is born in the war of economic selection. The war is between the past and the future. Once a greater culture is born, it erases cultures of the past. Past cultures strive to survive and thus the war is imminent and intence as cultu3ricide erases way more information than genocide. 

We do not smell this war with rooten flash on the streets.  

The war is now on the markets. Cultures compete for clients via products and prices instead of guns. Thus the war is now global and ligtning fast. Evolve culture lightning fast or die. That is evolution.


(To avoid confusion, this text is written in 2020. Update from the CEO “I donate to the war refugees. Any violation of human rights is a threat to the free markets and humankind. Humans should compete via fair market competition to evolve, otherwise the technology will destroy us.”)



Culture is not something what we have in our hearts. It is not a set of our beliefs. Culture is a set of actions. Who you are is what you do. Culture is how and which decisions are made, especially if no one sees.

We have beliefs and Principles and we will do everything to make them working. We leverage shocking rules to make it clear.

For example, if one is not following the Rule to be the client of the product her is building - her would not be able to build it.



We commit to follow LATOKEN Principles. If we violate any of them we report it, make our best to fix mistake and learn from the failure. We help teammates to follow the principles. If we think one is violating the principles - we will tell about it to her or speak up to her supervisor, and of course would not talk behind a person’s back without her supervisor.

1. Our Goal of Life is to make the world better with a product

Otherwise, what would one do in a startup? Why does startup need tension originated by conflicts of other goals with the innovator’s mission? How would one choose the right priorities? There will be constant tensions with our principles such as Client First, Ego Last or Never waste time or Get out of comfort. 

  1. Align your daily tasks with the product mission via grandma clear OKRs. If you do not understand the mission - make extra effort to understand. “Company has no vision or mission or culture”  is a top excuse of agents to freeride principals.
  2. If you need to be inspired - do not do this. Get out.

2. Clients First, Ego Last

  1. We are the users. Be the client of the product you are building.Test it, and talk with clients.
  2. Align each task and second of your life with the clients success. Architect 200 trln of your synapses and 100x more of synapses around for your life mission lasting beyond your body life. Every evening or weekend you have meaningful time with yourself, teammates, your relatives and friends helpful to achieve your mission. Isn’t it?
  3. Feel grievance about clients, not about yourself. Clients are not for serving our egos of being the rulers of the future.  Do not defend or excuse our ego.  
  4. Think big. Count in second- and third-order consequences. Learn from books of top tech founders and investors.
  5. Take a reasonable risk. Tolerate mistakes and do not tolerate incompetence. Mistakes are ok, if reported and learned. If you suffer - good, it means you are growing. 

3. Demo or Die. Focus to deliver, never seek excuses and remove bad apples doing the opposite

  1. Get shit done.  Hardwork and achievement is not a pleasant comfort travel, thus most people try to avoid it. Do not allow to sneak out, force to get shit done.
  2. Discover the root problem or blocker. Ask “why did it happen 4 times to get in-depth insight into what should be fixed.
  3. Crystalise blokers in projects update and solve one by one. If there are no such clarity, it is likely that the doers decided to work to prove that they should not do the task or task is undoable. Do not allow fake work, nor vague defined work. 
  4. Eliminate low standards or excuse seeking before a Bad apple spoils entire harvest. If others see that avoiding ownership and seeking excuse is a beneficial strategy - high performance strategy is not a Nash stable anymore and we are dead zombies.  
  5. Have your highest-performance responsibility area, limit jumping around. Know who you are and what your personal mission is. 
  6. Double effort when failed. Learning how to get out of shit is the greatest one. Get shit done.

4. Make transparent and accountable work of yourself and teammates to remove freeriders and resolve blockers for sportsman

  1. Transparent Work. Projects, Tasks and Work done of each teammate must be clear to you. Each standup you understand who did what yesterday, plan to do today and what are their blockers. Ensure the tasks have real stories Who need What for Why, comments for hours billed are clear and reasonable,   ask “stupid questions” if anything is unclear.
  2. Make teammates accountable. Grill evasive behaviours to push bad apple and freeriders out while making clear to others to avoid copying the toxic evasive strategy. If weekly Demo is not done - ask why a teammate did not push hard to resolve blockers. Smash attempts to avoid the questions asked or to blur details of the blockers. You critical thinking skills are very important to judge if there are excuses or real independent blockers. 
  3. Elimintate covering. Agents (bad apples and freeriders) are making friends to cover each other by injectig lies, changing topics when asked unpleasant questions and mutually avoiding writing clear stories, project updates and blockers. Crush them.
  4. Report mistakes. If you feel pain due to accountability, this means you are growing. Get our of comfort to grow.

4. Candid feedback, no politics

  1. Give open feedback asap. Wrong public feedback is way better than polite tacit disagreement and talking behind our backs - that is prohibited politics. We do not hide our opinions and never talk behind. If we suffer from our openness - this means we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up.
  2. Eliminate talking behind and gossips. We share with others only what we would say if the other person was in the room. If we discuss a misalignment - it should be heard by the person or her supervisors as we want to correct it. Otherwise it is likely to be collusion against a teammate, and potentially against all teammates and clients. We stop and report talking behind.
  3. Prefer productive open conflict to find a great solution over tacit compromise over mediocracy.  
  4. Get any feedback to grow. It does not matter if feedback is accurate or not. The ultimate feedback - startup and you are dead 10,000 to 1 if you do not do 10x, 10x and 10x better. You are dead means your culture will not be remembered and passed to next generations. Why do you live then?
  5. No politics. Negative public feedback should not change you attitude to a person under fire, work with her like with any other teammate. 

5.  Navy Seals to Every Role

  1. Raise the bar with any hire. Newcomers must be better than we are today, so we become greater tomorrow.
  2. Hire and raise your successor from day one. That is how you accelerate vesting and value of your stocks.
  3. Everyone is responsible for hiring. Managers are promoted based on their ability to attract and develop top talent.
  4. Do Sugar Cookie traning. Put a pressure early to learn if the Navy Seal is ready for the real encounter.

6. Be Ethically Radically Transparent, Yet Keep Our Secrets and Know Hows

  1. Grandma should understand your OKRs, tasks, and failures at first glance.
  2. Report mistakes. Hiding mistake espesially with a lie is a crime.
  3. Stories must be “Who needs What for Why”.
  4. Give open feedback. We do not hide our opinions and never backtalk. If we suffer from our openness - this means we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up. 
  5. Negative feedback in public meeting is better than no feedback. Especially if one demonstrates negligence to the principles.
  6. We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
  7. Keep confidential data under lock such as client personal data, salaries, bonuses, procedures related to security, our conflicts and hurdles.
  8. Report to supervisor and CEO if the Principles or Code of Ethics are violated or not working well, report any fake work, any freeriding or cheating.
  9. Speak up to compliance, do not wash our dirty linen in public outside company. Follow NDA contract obligations. Public can not be expert in our internal problems.

Cute apps and teammates

You may feel cute when touching your Apple mouse, this Coda platform, Google search bar, Facebook friend, Uber taxi buttons. 

You may imagine a designer drawing these apps.

Meet Alex and Anna

Alex is a beacon of zen-like calm, drawing inspiration from Anna's supportive smile. Her presence helps him strike a balance between work and life, enabling him to work smarter, not harder, in a state of productive harmony. Their cheerful teammates often gather around the latte machine, sharing stories about weekend movies, shopping adventures, favorite music, photography, and travel experiences. These casual interactions foster a sense of zen and vitality, fueling their enthusiasm for creating another beautiful feature.



Are you on the right and the same page with the team? 

Your first days’ orientation sets your entire career. 

And now you - meet the real tech builders. Meet Ben.



https://youtu.be/YxdZB7tBnlY?t=1176 



Click here if you have watched the above video

Ben is far from being a criminal. He is the mastermind behind calming apps like Coinbase, Ripple, Facebook, Twitter, Stripe, Airbnb, and 811 others. As a startup founder, he has achieved a $1.6 billion exit, and as an investor, he boasts 132+ exits through his venture capital fund, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which manages $20+ billion. Andreessen Horowitz is not the most sought-after investor for startups merely because of its financial resources.

Startups are drawn to Ben for the culture he fosters. It's this culture that enables startups to tackle difficult problems and deliver calming solutions to their clients.

Here's a glimpse into the culture he planted back in 2012:

Screenshot 2020-07-31 at 13.32.57.png

Screenshot 2020-08-13 at 20.31.57.png

Meet Alex. He's the designer behind the Shutterstock image at the top of this page. Alex is likely a competent freelancer who assists numerous clients with similar, basic needs. He avoids tackling complex problems, preferring to maintain a calm demeanor and focusing on simpler issues that he can address in his zen mode. As a pleasant individual, he's a good model for most people who prefer to see average individuals like themselves for comfort. Alex is not one to challenge the status quo, as he doesn't want to upset anyone. He's great at posing for the camera, but not so great at solving the tough problems required to create a new, valuable, and viable product.

Anna is his girlfriend. Her primary goal is to ensure that Alex "belongs to her," investing his time and money into their future children. Therefore, her main job isn't her career. Her job is to bind him with weekend rituals (the very thing feminists strive to overcome). If Alex begins to grow too quickly, he might outgrow her and seek independence. Therefore, she might resist him working in a VC startup aiming for skyrocketing growth. She'd prefer him to be a freelancer under her control, who is just slightly more successful than the husbands of their friends. She seeks to balance his success against the risk of losing him, teaching him about work-life balance.

Simultaneously, if Alex starts falling behind one of her friend's husbands, she'll point it out. So, Alex isn't interested in his friends' success and prefers them to be slightly behind him. If his friend starts discussing something meaningful, he'd signal, "Are you trying to show that you're smarter than us?" and switch the valuable topic to the safe nonsense of a football show, travel, or music.

Their imagined happy teammates can't build a new viable feature in a startup. They're unlikely to break free from the mediocre social gravity produced by their comfort rituals, such as discussing shopping or the weather.

Real startup teammates would ask these people to leave the startup.

They'd wonder which killer feature he learned from competing apps over the weekend. Is the mock-up added into the backlog priorities? Why hasn't she tested it with a no-code tool to check client interest? They'd share insights on user growth or culture learned from meaningful time with their like-minded friends and relatives or from books by "super angels.”

A great product is built to make clients feel calm about hard problems solved by the product. Startup members want to move out of the calm comfort zone to solve hard problems for clients. That's their life goal - to make the world a better place with a product that shifts the boundaries of what's possible.

Their culture is shaped by this goal, not by mediocre social gravity.

So, where do you learn about culture?

From normal Alexes or from titans like Ben?

Start-uppers are either Unemployable down-shifters OR Champions made to change the world.

 

Welcome to learn counterintuitive Hard things about hard things. Our main product is the culture which can shift frontiers. Fuck off zen freelancers, welcome visionary achievers.

The Code of Ethics

 LATOKEN Code of Business Conduct and Ethics



The LATOKEN Code of Ethics and the Principles embody the firm’s commitment to benefit the society by adopting the decentralised technology to make investments, trading, payments and money management as a whole available worldwide at a fraction of costs. Access to investments makes people global stakeholders learning how the world works and empowers them to influence the future. Access to money makes people freer to choose how to grow by buying products and services.

Our mission is to put financial life at fingertips.

So people can use money to bring ideas into life and become stakeholders of a better future. 

Why do we need the Code

The Code sets the basic and powerful rules such as prevention of conflicts of interests. The Code is the fundament for more sophisticated principles and the culture needed for exceptional performance to achieve the core mission. The Code empowers the team to make the right choices and to overcome hurdles and “impossible” things and ensures they are done with joy and courage. This firm’s commitment implies a combination of vision coupled with hard work and ethics leading to extreme performance needed to make a structural change in the way people fundraise, invest and manage money. 

The capital market manages the planetary resources and mankind's future. The structural changes here mean intensive conflicts between those who benefit from the change and those who lose. It is the matter of our viability to build the team which is capable of overcoming such conflicts, to structure the support base, and to minimize costs for those who lose (Uber transformed taxi business and had scandals and scrutiny across the world..). Furthermore, we shall be prepared for hurdles coming from the regional political risks, devastated local capital market expertise and the short-sighted rent-seeking cultural patterns dominating the local labour market.  

Additional layers of cultural complexity come from the infant stage of the decentralised industry lacking regulations and practices needed to evolve to meet modern ethical standards and regulation. We acknowledge that some of the industry business practices can not be avoided by the industry players as such avoidance significantly impairs their market position. In this way, collective behavioural change is required and could be achieved with the help of regulation. We are committed to develop the industry rules and practices and call for regulation where necessary. We are committed to meet the highest ethical standards and be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Code applies to all of our teammates. 

Reporting Issues under the Code

It is critical that you strive to identify and escalate potential issues before they lead to problems. When in doubt, you should ask questions about the potential application of this Code to your supervisor or senior management and the CEO. 

Should you become aware of any existing or potential violation of this Code, promptly notify senior management or the CEO of the firm. 

Violations of the Code 

We take this Code and your obligations under it very seriously and will take any disciplinary or preventive action deemed appropriate to address existing or potential violations of the Code, up to and including termination of contract, stock bonuses/options or legal actions. Violations of the Code may also constitute violations of law, which may result in criminal or civil penalties for you and the firm.

Put interests of the firm and its clients ahead of personal interests

Put interests of the firm and clients ahead of personal goals - that is a fundamental cooperation basis to build trust, stellar performance and great product, and, as a result, sustainable growth of your character and career. We do not tolerate short-sighted sighted strategies designed to look better or avoid responsibility or to protect the comfortable status quo at the expense of the company performance and clients. You must detect and prevent  behavioral patterns such as: faking work and results, hiding mistakes or weaknesses to look better, defending yourself to avoid responsibility and effort, sabotaging those who come to fix something which you failed to do, involving others into negative back talk against peers, supervisor or the firm.

Your leadership role is to inspire teammates and to align them with our common goal, with our mission. You do it by showing your commitment, hardworking and goal-oriented spirit. You set the bar and raise it constantly for yourself and teammates. The dedication of our teammates to the firm and clients, the intense effort they do is greater than one finds in most other organizations. 

Prevent talking behind one’s back, impose constructive problem solving

You must immediately stop negative back talking when you witness such behavior and request to invite the named colleague to participate in the discussion. An exemption is the discussion involving a supervisor of the person. Discussions of colleagues’ mistakes and their personalities in their absence allows a person  to take an unfair advantage over such colleagues and get short term benefits while causing extensive damage to the morale and career of teammates and performance of the firm. The same applies to any propagation of negative information or talk against the company in the absence of the CEO.

Personal Conflicts of Interest 

A personal conflict of interest occurs when your private interest improperly interferes with the interests of the firm. Actions or relationships that create personal conflicts of interest are prohibited, unless approved by the firm in written form. It is important that you carefully consider whether any of your activities or relationships, including volunteer positions outside the firm, could cause a conflict (or the appearance of a conflict) with the interests of the firm. Even if an activity seems unrelated to your role at the firm, you may be required to obtain pre-approval before engaging in it. Additionally, personal gain and advantage must never take precedence over your obligations to the firm. You must never use or attempt to use your position at the firm to obtain any improper personal benefit for yourself, family member(s) or any other individual or group. If you are aware of a transaction or relationship that could give rise to a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest, you should discuss the matter promptly with the CEO. When in doubt, raise the question for appropriate consideration. 

Business Opportunities

You are prohibited from taking for yourself (or directing to any other person) a business opportunity that is discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position at the firm, unless the firm explicitly in written form approves such use of the opportunity. More generally, you are prohibited from using corporate property, information or position for personal gain or competing with the firm. The prudent course of action is to obtain pre-approval from the CEO for any use of firm property or services that is not solely for the benefit of the firm. 

Non Solicitation

Any solicitation to work outside of the firm mission must be prevented and reported. Such solicitations include discussions of job market opportunities, personal startup ideas, introductions to head hunters or any person for a hiring reason.  

Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations 

You must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those related to insider trading, financial reporting, money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption.  

Generally, if you are aware of material nonpublic information relating to the firm, any of our clients or any other private or governmental issuer of securities, you cannot buy or sell any securities of those issuers or recommend that another person buy, sell or hold the securities of those issuers. Questions regarding the purchase or sale of any firm securities or any securities of issuers that you are familiar with by virtue of your role at LATOKEN should be directed to an appropriate ethics contact prior to any purchase or sale.

Protecting Confidential Information 

In the course of business, our people often have access to confidential or proprietary information about the firm, our clients, prospective clients or other third parties. Our business and reputation depend on the commitment of each of you to protect this information. You must maintain the confidentiality of the information with which you are entrusted, including complying with information barrier procedures applicable to your business. The only exception is when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential or proprietary information includes, among other things, any non-public information concerning the firm (including its businesses, financial performance, results or prospects) and any non-public information provided by a third party with the expectation that the information will be kept confidential and used solely for the business purpose for which it was conveyed. 

Equal Employment Opportunities and Commitment to Diversity 

Concern for the personal dignity of each individual is an indispensable element of the standards we set for ourselves at LATOKEN. We focus our personnel decisions on merit and contribution to the firm’s success. The firm affords equal employment opportunities to all qualified persons without regard to any impermissible criteria or circumstances. We do not tolerate any type of discrimination prohibited by law, including harassment. We value diversity as an important asset that enhances our culture, helps us serve clients well and maximizes return for shareholders. For us to excel, we must create for our people an inclusive environment that welcomes and supports differences and encourages input from all perspectives. 

Protecting and Properly Using Firm Assets 

You should protect the firm’s assets and ensure their efficient use. All firm assets should be used for legitimate business purposes only. 

Business Principles 

We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do. While recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to the client’s problems. We pride ourselves on pioneered many of the practices and techniques that will become standard in the industry. We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best person for every job.  In a service business, we know that without the best people, we cannot be the best firm. We offer our people the opportunity to move ahead more rapidly than is possible at most other places. Advancement depends on merit and we have yet to find the limits to the responsibility our best people are able to assume. For us to be successful, our men and women must reflect the diversity of the communities and cultures in which we operate. That means we must attract, retain and motivate people from many backgrounds and perspectives. Being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be. 

We stress teamwork in everything we do. While individual creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often produces the best results. We have no room for those who put their personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm and its clients. The dedication of our people to the firm and the intense effort they give to their jobs are greater than one finds in most other organizations. We think that this is an important part of our success. We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve. We want to be big enough to undertake the largest project that any of our clients could contemplate, yet small enough to maintain the loyalty, the intimacy and the esprit de corps that we all treasure and that contribute greatly to our success. We constantly strive to anticipate the rapidly changing needs of our clients and to develop new services to meet those needs. We know that the world of finance will not stand still and that complacency can lead to extinction. 

Additional Procedures

All of our employees are required to affirm that they have reviewed the Code and will comply with it.   Our clients’ interests always come first. If we serve our clients well, our own success will follow. Our assets are our people, capital and reputation. If any of these is ever diminished, the last is the most difficult to restore. Despite the infant industry development stage, regulation and common business practices, we are dedicated and we will do all we can to comply with the letter and spirit of the laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us. Significant employee stock ownership aligns the interests of our employees and our shareholders. We take great pride in the professional quality of our work. We have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake. Though we may be involved in a wide variety and heavy volume of activity, we would, if it came to a choice, rather be best than biggest.


The Shocking Rules

One is able to build the product only if he/she is a user of what he/she is building



That is about our Clients first principle. Clients are first to build, non clients should be free from such burden. Find and hire clients only.

Missed the book “What You Do Is Who You Are” in 30 days - we missed you



Those who do not learn the culture of Coinbase and Ripple investors from the book What You Do Is Who You Are - can not stay with us as it violates the principles; Learn from Titans, Always Learn, Find a 10x better way to do things. Any newcomer has 30 days to read it and share their takeaways.

Newcomers are hired if beat world benchmarks over weekend hackathons  



Otherwise it violates the principles: 

* Never waste time. Always Learn. 
* Excel to shift the highest world benchmarks. Find a 10x better way to do things. 
* Comfort is death - get out of comfort. 
* Align each task and second of your life with the clients success.
* Magnet the people whose culture you want to pass in generations

  

Are they using their weekends to excel and find a 10x better way to solve problems? Or are they hanging out with those who are jealous of her growth and demand rituals protecting the comfort status quo? Do they have meaningful, or comfort or conflict type of relations with their friends and family? What is their social gravity - up or down?

Do they reflect on the week's experience or try to forget it and delete the brain connections holding the memories? Would you try to recover these connections over Monday and Tuesday?

Test their social gravity - is it about protection of their comfort zone or excelling to shift to the highest world benchmarks
High load pressure of Trading after the bubble

Traders manage the planet. Trading makes people stakeholders of the future. That is not easy and painful for newbies traders. Thus there are unhappy traders and high load pressure. Are you comfortable to leverage high load pressure for creativity?



Trading makes people stakeholders of the future. Traders and investors are the global brain predicting the future and optimising resource allocation to maximize cash flows and stock prices growth. Stock prices change means change in workforce allocation. Change in stocks prices impact product prices, labour prices, education prices and even dating “prices”. This price contagion or price transmission through markets optimize goals, values, feelings and actions of billions to maximise humankind future output.

The reason why you read this text via large screen of mobile device is because of investors who envisioned you with this device a decade ago. 

New traders often start like gamblers and loose money to those who are trained to predict the future market share and cash flows of traded companies. 

Todays’ decisions of politicians, regulators and firms impact economy performance in some years. Some of the newbies start to connect the dots: how todays news impact the value of stocks in their portfolio and wellbeing. They start to see the future now and act as stakeholders to make it better. They are a better educated voters, so politicians have less chance to fool them.

55% of adult US population bought stocks in 2019 only. This number is between 0 to 5% in other countries and we have a lot of work to educate and help people to become stakeholders of the humankind future.

Yet, most of scam mentions are to speedup customer support to push KYC forward or restore access to account frozen due to suspicious activity (such as password brut force attacks). After the issue is resolved, a client would unlikely to remove negative tweet or review. 

Other categories of negative mentions by order of magnitude: 

* High fees for tier 3 tokens where 10-100x price jump resulted in corresponding fees growth before we figure this out and fix. Dormant accounts fees were also negative contributors, so we removed them.
* Weak IEO results. As the largest primary market for digital assets in the world with 170+ IEOs since 2017 we make it easy for entrepreneurs to connect with investors. Do not take it wrong, we do not sell or make investment advise. That is not an exchange business - we must be neutral. Most of startups would fail to be attractive for investors. Anyway, some entrepreneurs expect to pay 2 BTC and get 20 BTC back. Why? Is it their competence or our sales managers solicitation? How would we control communications with prospects of a hundred sales ambassadors? We made IEO service free of charge in 2019 and such conflicts calmed down.
* Blackmailing activity (pay me or I will spread negative reviews real or libels)



We have close to 1 million accounts and 474 “latoken scam” mentions in google. It does not mean that we have 474 legal cases. Binance does not have 19 900 legal cases.

In crypto Scam often have a meaning of an adjective intended to attract attention to negative feelings like “fuck, it does not work well”. In fiat world the word “scam” mentioned against a company often trigger criminal investigation against company or a libel lawsuit against the claimant.

Screenshot 2020-10-29 at 10.10.10.png

In google search results “Binance scam” is mentioned 19 900 times vs 20 million “Binance” or 0.1% . “LATOKEN scam” is mentioned 474 times vs 1 million “LATOKEN” or 0.047% negative mention ratio.

Crypto trading industry after the bubble means market full of conflicts, scandals and pressure needed to give a birth to new era of internet of value. 



Thousands of crypto startups failed. That is normal for VC market and comparable with dot com bubble. It took 15 years to recover investments for average investor into tech companies index. Most of the companies which were in this index back to 2000 are bankrupt, few rule the planet today. 

latoken market.jpg



Blockchain outperforms internet. Crypto capitalisation recovered 70% of the bubble decline in 2 years comparing to dot com bubble’s 13 years for corresponding recovery.  

However, scale of people involved and lack of regulation facilitated greater number of scums, shareholders and teams’ conflicts, and blackmailing. 

Blackmailing attacks are designed to impair clients or team relations are the norm here to force startups to pay to blackmailer. We do not pay.

Would you invest in a person who would likely to flee at any moment due to negative news?

We prefer to check her “immunity” to conflicts and ability to leverage pressure and constructive conflicts for growth, creativity and performance.  



In New Orlean (mid 19th), you would not find job or get a loan or marry without immunity to yellow fever. Companies were loath to train an employee who might succumb to an outbreak. Fathers were hesitant to marry their daughters to husbands who might die. You should get diseased with yellow fever (50% chance to die that time) in order to get the immunity needed to become a real citizen.

High load capital markets and bubble scandals enables us to leverage brutal feedback. The main goal of such feedback is to ensure that adequate performers do not cover each other to protect their comfort status quo at expense of clients and top performers. 

They should either to grow into top performers who challenge each other to grow and perform, instead of covering each others’ lack of competence and effort. Otherwise adequate performers should go to legacy companies where such behaviour flourish. 

If one violates our The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future we give an immediate public feedback. If person leverage the feedback to change - he could become a great teammate. If her is trying to defend herself with growing fake statements and backtalk (to prevent backtalk defence strategy we, like Netflix, fire for both backtalk and failure to report backtalk) - we want to see it on her first week.

Thus comfort with pressure is a must. And we leverage it for First week: star-blast pressure to filter out mediocracy







 


First week: star-blast pressure to filter out mediocracy

Trading industry after the bubble means a market full of conflicts, scandals, and pressure needed to give birth to the new era of the internet of value. Thus comfort with pressure is a must. 

Thus, instead of giving a few light weeks to adopt, we use the first weeks to test:

i) if a person can leverage pressure to grow and hit targets and 

ii)  if they tend to be an adequate performer, free-rider or top performer.

If you are a hiring manager instructing a newcomer, you might notice that some newcomers agree and confirm that they understand everything you show. In fact, you may realise that they do not understand what you show to them.  

Then you probably think: Is it an attempt to look better and to fake mental work? Or do they want to please you instead of asking to be more clear?

Both patterns are red flags of upcoming fake work and attempt to make friends by covering their fake work.

Unlike Netflix, LATOKEN would not prefer to fire, we would give brutal feedback to see if person changes or tries to defend himself with more fake statements and backtalk. (To prevent such defense we like Netflix fire for both backtalk and failure to report backtalk.)

Top performers, unlike adequate performers, point on poor or fake work and challenge teammates to fix it. An adequate performer would cover poor or fake work and expect them to be covered in return. They are the source of the Free Rider problem. Average people would decrease their effort by 44% in a team of 7 compared to a team of 1 in the rope pulling competition as Ringelmann and many other researchers confirmed. Professional sportsman would not decrease their effort even when the team is growing and transparency declining.

1. "Make your Bed” every morning
2. Find the weak heart and eliminate from ever becoming a Navy Seal
3. Get over being the "Sugar Cookie" and keep moving forward

“Make your Bed” every morning

Today, we found that the Bed for operations is the accuracy of Platform ops interfaces. Like Bed for Navy Seals, it is seen by most of the teammates each morning and sets attitude to their other tasks from a DB or a code architecture to communications with clients.  How they chose the structure, size, color of fonts, blocks, shortcuts are small vector that gravitates us constantly. 

Know what is your  “Bed”

Which small daily task sets the day for all of us? Is it Stories, Standups, your OKR report?

Find the weak heart and eliminate from ever becoming a Navy Seal.

Today, I interviewed another cancer, which was proud to tell that he is working only 15% of his day for Yandex which he joined 6 months ago. He was proud to tell that the Sovok deserves to be cheated and teammates are ok to have him as a bar lower. 

Find the weak heart and eliminate from ever becoming a Navy Seal



Basic SEAL training is six months of long torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacles courses, unending calisthenics, days without sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable.

It is six months of being constantly harassed by professionally trained warriors who seek to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL.

But, the training also seeks to find those students who can lead in an environment of constant stress, chaos, failure and hardships [of new markets]. 

Startup teammates are navy seals defeating entropy on undiscovered territory to build the future. If you want to change the world..

Get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward

“For failing the uniform inspection, the student had to run, fully clothed into the surf zone and then, wet from head to toe, roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand. The effect was known as a “sugar cookie.” You stayed in that uniform the rest of the day — cold, wet and sandy.



There were many a student who just couldn’t accept the fact that all their effort was in vain. That no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right — it was unappreciated. Those students didn’t make it through training.

Those students didn’t understand the purpose of the drill. You were never going to succeed. You were never going to have a perfect uniform. Sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform, you still end up as a sugar cookie. It’s just the way life is sometimes. If you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.”

Implication for LATOKEN: be ready to endure negative feedback from the market, blackmailers and enviers. If we have trained our IEO team they might have endure launch of tokenized interest in SpaceX. Thus we would be way more advanced in IEO product.

Focus on The Critical Hit

Tom King, a former star boxer, found himself yearning for a steak. He had spent his earnings from past victories generously, choosing to travel instead of training. In his last fight, he performed well but failed to deliver a critical hit for the win. As a result, he was now so impoverished that local merchants wouldn't even loan him enough money for a steak. 

The next day, he was to fight against a rising star, Sandel. All he could afford to eat was bread and gravy, and he had to send his wife and children to bed without food.

King lost the fight. He was convinced that if he had been able to eat a steak before the fight, the outcome would have been different. Having already taken out credit on the loser's share of the purse, he left the fight penniless and in despair. King wept during his two-mile walk home, unable to afford a cab ride. He knew he would never win again.



"A Piece of Steak"  by Jack London, 1909



Consider a jaguar that chases an antelope several times but fails to catch it. The jaguar may run out of energy for the next chase. Each subsequent chase with less energy means a lower probability of success and a lower chance of replenishing its energy. The jaguar is in its death valley, where death is imminent. The jaguar will die of hunger.

San Francisco is full of homeless entrepreneurs - Jaguars who went into the Death valley.

Mobilise effort to make a critical hit to break the wall or all of your work will be in vain, leading to burnout.

If multiple random light shots can't break a heavy wall, then you've just wasted energy, and you'll die, taking your teammates down with you. Breaking a wall means delivering a change in business with sustainable value that exceeds the costs used and ideally surpasses alternative costs.

You must have a laser-focused vision to hit the weak spot with a single, well-powered shot.

You have one or a few shots to take aim. If the shot is too light, we won't be able to determine if the aim was correct.

If you break the wall, you get recharged. If you don't hit and if you're a normal person, your brain will command you to conserve energy with each miss. Consequently, you'll be less likely to make a sufficient effort to make a hit with each subsequent shot. This is the Death Valley.

That's why we seek exceptional people determined to succeed. They never give up, never quit because they learned to make critical hits back in their childhood.

What did they learn in childhood that forged their character to break walls that stop others?

They learned to be conscious and responsible for their actions. They learned how to use each miss to correct their aim, double their effort, and ensure the target will be hit, unlike those who prefer to make excuses. Unlike excuse seekers, strong characters can endure failure while doing everything to hit with a single shot at all costs.

They focus with clear WHO needs WHAT for WHY stories and prohibit others from blurring tasks with vague, poorly structured definitions.

Focus for crit hit, be determined to succeed, never give up, never quit.

“The Death Valley”

#nakedmanagement

"The Death Valley" is a self-perpetuating decline in the probability of achieving a product-market fit. This decline is due to a decrease in the effort to make critical hits as the team wastes energy and sees a lack of traction. The self-enforcing process begins with a lack of vision for the end result. A team that doesn't see where it's going, won't get anywhere. A lack of progress means a lower probability of getting a return on effort. Thus, there's less incentive to make the extra effort to start developing a vision for the end result.

Creating a vision for the end result requires extra effort:

* The effort to visualize it: Write a WHO/WHAT/WHY Story, Vision novel, Problems/Solutions, To Do, draw a mind map (avoid seduction to write just few bullet points, always write Stories at least to build a habit)
* The painful responsibility of acknowledging the result (Recognizing that sometimes what you do is useless, regardless of the effort put in).

If I don't see where I'm going, then I'm not responsible. I'm just doing something someone told me to do or what I feel like doing at the moment, regardless of whether it's needed for the clients or not.

Instinctively, I want recognition, higher titles, a better salary, and more influence, while wanting less responsibility and effort. So, I aim for a higher risk-adjusted ROI on my effort. If I don't measure the result for clients and don't take responsibility for that, then the value for clients is not in my ROI formula. Naturally, I expend energy only on variables in my ROI formula: recognition, titles, salary, influence. There are no client metrics here. And I feel demotivated if I don't get recognition, etc., for consulting teammates and jumping around, I feel the tensions of normal and median people. This is the lack of commitment and accountability well described in “Five dysfunctions of teams“.

Connect your brain's ROI formula with the client metrics, or abandon the ambition to build a product and remain a median person.

The Shocking Rules

The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future 


Fire good ones for freedom

Based on  “No Rules Rule of Netflix” shortlisted by Financial Times & McKinsey as a business book of 2020

Star blast pressure 

To avoid bankruptcy in 2001 Reed Hastings tried to sell Netflix to the old video rental market leader - Blockbuster. He got rejection. He was desperate: how would Netflix compete with the old giants if there is no investors around for his experiments after dot com bubble. Generally, new companies should not exist. Why not Blockbuster build a new product and up-sell it to its user base at negligible client acquisition costs?

The step to Dense Talent

He had to fire 1/3 of their team. They fired nice guys with adequate performance, pessimistic super performers, less motivated, over motivated hard-workers with poor judgement. 

“Morale in the office was low, and it was about to get lower. We had to lay off a third of our workforce,” Hastings says. “We didn’t have any obviously poor performers. So we divided the staff into two piles: the 80 highest performers who we would keep, and 40 less amazing ones” 

Fired people were pissed off and slammed doors. Reed expected a backslash from remaining people angry for firing their friends and insecure about their future.

Suddenly, performance soared. He and his teammates started to love to come to work

Netflix realised that “For top performers, a great workplace isn’t about a lavish office, a beautiful gym, or free sushi. It’s about people who can help you be better. When every member is excellent, performance spirals upward as employees learn from and motivate one another.” (link)

Netflix made their first step to build the culture which made 200+m clients happy, $250+ billion value and Blockbuster bankrupt. 

culture-21-638.jpg

Adequate performers and free riders kill

Blockbuster passed away like many others due to the same reason: Normal performers and free riders. Normal teams tolerate those who perform on par with team average or below. And it kills them.

One weak teammate diminish team performance by 30-40% found professor Will Felps. He compared performance for teams of college students — where a “bad apple teammate” actor was added to behave like a slacker, a jerk, or a pessimist.

Normal performance is infectious and magnify the Report Free Riding  which kills organisations. Adequate performers prefer to cover each other rather than to challenge each other to overachieve. To control and maintain performance of medium people and free riders, organizations build complex rules and bureaucracy at expense of creativity and agility. Vicious circle.

Fire average people and foster candor to enable creativity

Netflix’s managed to get out of this vicious circle. Their massive lay off of the average and below staff created the talent density. Reed found that talent density coupled with candid feedback solve the adequate performers and free rider problems. So less bureaucracy needed to control these two categories. Now company can afford Freedom for creativity guided by responsibility for mission and goals.

It was a scandal “do you treat average people like garbage you want to trash out to other companies”?

Other would argue, why would you put such harsh wording. Normal people should work in the companies of the past. That is normal and deserve respect. Fire with respect.

There were some scandals naming Steve Jobs as a jerk. He was cruel to embarrass employees and fired publicly for doubting that a task is doable. There were younger wartime companies cultures (outlined by Ben Horowitz 5 years later), and Zappos with their sweet family HR PR campaign. 

Reed’s slides became shocking documentation of a real tech culture unexpected from a relatively large creative company. 

Psychological safety is for the past

Harvard professors prayed for psychological safety as a must for creativity. The academic consensus was: Netflix culture can not exist in large organisations (the reason why tech companies and definitely startups avoid hiring MBAs).

Since then Netflix capitalisation grown 100x, Nasdaq 9x (tech), Dow Jones (traditional industries) 2.5x.

22677.jpegScreenshot 2020-10-11 at 14.26.44.png







10 years after that scandal, Gary Pisano admitted at Harvard Business Review:

“Innovative cultures are generally depicted as pretty fun. When I asked the same managers to describe such cultures, they readily provided a list of characteristics identical to those extolled by management books: tolerance for failure, willingness to experiment, psychological safety, highly collaborative, and nonhierarchical.

The easy-to-like behaviours that get so much attention are only one side of the coin. They must be counterbalanced by some tougher and frankly less fun behaviors. A tolerance for failure requires an intolerance for incompetence. A willingness to experiment requires rigorous discipline. Psychological safety requires comfort with brutal candor. Collaboration must be balanced with individual accountability. And flatness requires strong leadership. Innovative cultures are paradoxical. Unless the tensions created by this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative culture will fail.”

Screenshot 2020-10-11 at 15.11.15.png





In 2009 the new cultural era was born. The goal of life “happiness” turned into goal of life “meaningfulness”. Which mean you must go out of comfort to grow and shift frontiers to create value. Otherwise you can not work in fast evolving tech companies. The companies which rule the planet today or tomorrow. These scandals and cultural change nurtured a scalable labour force able to build SpaceX.

Freedom and Responsibility

Freedom sucks without Talent density and Candor

In 1994 Reed Hastings found his sales manager billing his previous company with $3000+ ($700 in 1990x) for one hotel night. Instead of demonstrative firing he introduced rules to approve travel and accommodation. He made many other rules such as you need an approval if you come to office with a pet.  

Today Netflix does not have any travel and vacation policy. No Rules Rule.

Reed warns: “Once you have build talent density, you can safely address candor. Only then can you safely began remove policies that control your staff.” 

If you do not have talent density - addressing candor is risky. If you do not have Talent Density and Candor - Freedom will fail. Adequate performers with free riders will lower the bar and force top performers to quit. Adequate performers would help each other to protect their comfort and call jerks those who raise the bar. A players attract A players to grow. B attract C players to feel comfort as look adequate comparing to C. Fire B players or B will push A out in order to defend their comfort. Keep only top performers and establish candor to enable freedom and creativity. 

Build the Culture of Freedom and Responsibility:

Step 1. Build Talent Density: Great work place is Stunning Colleagues. Top performers should hire top performers challenging each other to overachieve and fire adequate performers who prefer to cover each others mediocracy. When achieved - build candor.

Step 2. Build Candor: Say what you really think, especially negative feedback, - with positive intent. No backtalk. Fire for backtalk or for failure to report backtalk.

Only if you have 1+2 move to:

Step 3. Reduce Controls and Bureaucracies: Growth of top performers should exceed growth of complexity. Top performers should be disciplined and have freedom to be creatively focused on clear goals and strategy.

Be Defenceless to be Strong 
Report Free Riding

These guys above seem to do their best.

Mr. Ringelmann would doubt it. He would estimate their performance is at least 44% below their potential as there are at least 7 participants on the picture. I would add that they are likely to exaggerate expression of effort comparing to their facial expression when they pull the rope alone. Welcome to the Free Rider problem a part the Principal-Agent Problem or Agency Theory (btw it is big contributor Paul Milgrom won Nobel Prize 2020).



r.png

Ringelmann (1913) found that having group members work together on a task (e.g., pulling a rope) actually results in significantly less effort than when individual members are acting alone. Ringelmann discovered that as more and more people are added to a group, the group often becomes increasingly inefficient, ultimately violating the notion that group effort and team participation reliably leads to increased effort on behalf of the members.

Subsequent research has aided the further development of the Ringelmann effect theory. Most notably, Ingham, Levinger, Graves, and Peckham (1974) discovered that group members continue to exhibit reductions in rope-pulling force even after being placed in pseudo-groups (i.e., groups composed of confederates and one, true participant). In their study, Ingham et al. (1974) directed confederates to pretend to pull on a rope by faking exertion, suggesting to the real participant that all members were working together. What proves of interest here is that because there was virtually no coordination between the participant and the confederates (they were not physically taking part in the actions), poor communication cannot account for the decrease in effort.[11] Therefore, Ingham et al. (1974) support the assertion that motivational losses largely determine an individual’s decline in performance when acting as a member of a group.

In addition, research has shown that participants who have previous experience in a team sport may not show the Ringelmann effect. 

The reason why teammates put less effort is because they can free ride each other if nobody can measure their effort (here is an asymmetry of information) and punish for cheating. Hard workers are in disadvantage as they would lose the most energy, while the prize would be spliced equally independently of effort. Thus hardwork is not a beneficial and desirable strategy (eg. it is not Nash stable as someone can pursue a different strategy with a larger benifit). 

Furthermore free riders tend to cooperate to cover each other and protect their status quo by lowering the bar for transparency and performance.

The star-blast pressure of market competition force teams to give a birth to cultures which penalise free riding. In fact companies compete by how they are successful to solve the free rider problem. Culture is how this problem is solved.

The most powerful invention here is the transparency and accountability for the result well encoded in our The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future .

If you see someone tweak her OKRs to look better - make it transparent

If you see someone pretend to work - make it transparent

If you see someone cover her mistakes or negligence - make it transparent

If you see someone seek excuses - make it transparent

Make free riding transparent by speaking up or asking questions at morning sync or unit/ceomessage slack. Get this shit out of our culture and embrace those who do not tolerate free riders.





Screenshot 2020-09-18 at 13.22.32.png



Remember:

New companies generally should not exist

New companies could exist only because they invent a better culture a better solution to the free rider problem  to punch through status quo.

Get Shit Done or Raise The Bar Rule 
Run Through The Death Valley

My interest in startups was sparked when I discovered that Stanford alumnus Maxim Faldin had launched Wikimart, Russia's equivalent to Amazon. In 2010, I was captivated by his blog, where he envisioned how tech entrepreneurs could shape the future. However, a decade later, I learned that Maxim had declared personal bankruptcy, with a debt of approximately $3 million, while Wikimart had lost around $83 million in investments.

It's important to note that only about one in 10,000 startups make it to an IPO. Statistically, it's far more likely that you'll hear about my bankruptcy than news of my team and I building a unicorn. However, we believe we are outliers due to our culture of hitting sequential targets towards a significant mission. This is why you're reading this piece on our wartime culture deck, one of the most detailed in the world.

latoken culture.png



Don't misunderstand me. Changing the world is a challenging endeavor, and some people are born to attempt it. They understand that  Comfort is Suicide. . Maxim, despite his setbacks, changed the world by paving the way for people like you and me with his efforts. He could still leverage his experience to make a significant impact next time.

So, where are the other startups that don't make it to IPO? They're in the "Death Valley."

The "Death Valley" is a self-reinforcing decline in the probability of achieving product-market-timing fit. This decline is due to a decrease in effort to make critical hits as the team wastes energy and sees a lack of traction.

If a jaguar chases an antelope several times and fails to catch it, she may run out of energy for the next chase. Each subsequent chase with less energy means a lower probability of success to recharge energy. At some point, the jaguar enters her death valley, where death is imminent. The jaguar will die from hunger.

San Francisco is full of homeless entrepreneurs - jaguars who ventured into the Death Valley.

This self-reinforcing process begins with a lack of vision of the result, leading to inaccurate performance evaluation, declining performance standards, and the emergence of free riders.

Free riders will reinforce the blurring of the vision and results to benefit from the principal-agent problem (agents increase the asymmetry of information to cheat principals). If a coalition of agents is stronger than principals, a turnaround is impossible.

Agents avoid performance transparency. 

Vision of the result means extra costs which agents prefer to avoid:

* The effort to make the result clear (would you write a Who/What Why Story if you can do less effort by writing a few bullets?)
* The painful responsibility for the result (recognizing that what you do is useless).

Agents feel resistance to do extra effort for clarity as it means responsibility. If I do not see where to go, then I am not responsible. I am just doing something somebody said and also doing what I want to do at the moment, whether it is needed for clients or not.

What do agents want? Higher salary and titles, recognition, and influence to protect the above for less responsibility and effort.

Agents optimize the Return On Investment of their effort to maximize output as measured by their above utility function unlinked from clients and company.

Principals have different variables in their utility function: Principals grow the number of successful clients and stock options value.

 And they invest full responsibility and effort to achieve such goals of life. They put clients first, ego last.

The agent will feel demotivated if they receive candid feedback about the lack of transparency of their impact on clients' success. Transparency and impact on clients are not in their utility function. They need recognition and promotion. Their effort is about team destructive self-educating, covering other teammates, and lowering standards to consolidate the political support base of other agents.

The line is crossed if the fake effort is rewarded. 

The line to the valley was already crossed when one of the sportsmen who faked his effort to row in one season is with the team in the next season. This is likely to mean that teammates did not report a free rider as they decided to cheat and cover each other in the next season. Thus, the coach will be less likely to detect and punish this pattern. Cheating will become a Nash stable strategy as it gives an immediate advantage over a full effort strategy.

Professional sportsmen do not fake effort in the Ringelmann rope polling experiment, because the coach knows each game if they are losing and get rid of free riders fast.

If the team and coach have a blurred vision of the result and cannot measure performance - all of their work is likely to be cheating from the very beginning. Even if they believed that they were hardworking, they were hard working to learn politics.

Is Maxim desperate here to get rid of agents collected on scaling before building the principals’ culture?


Checklist your survival machine. A startup is a survival machine designed to spot innovation to punch through competition with legacy companies.

Is the computational power of your machine growing or declining? Is it capable of overcoming a stock bubble burst or a civil war or a pandemic? Is it producing diamonds out of star blast pressure or dust?

Here is a checklist of the Death Valley risk:

1. Are there verifiable deliveries in Monthly and Weekly commitments?
  1. Can any of the product teammates tell which hypothesis they test this sprint?
  2. Which number will prove or disapprove the hypothesis?
  3. Why was this hypothesis prioritized over dozens of other hypotheses?
  4. How does her task help to verify the hypothesis?
2. Is the performance of teammates real-time transparent and they are accountable?
  1. Can most of your team tell last week's performance numbers of most of the other units?
  2. Can most of your teammates name their personal key performance numbers change over last week?
  3. Do those who leave the company have the worst performing numbers, and those who perform stay?
  4. Do your teammates question teammates with weak numbers or enjoy declining standards?
3. Do teammates challenge each other to perform?
  1. If a person tells vague or misleading information, is he immediately questioned by teammates?
  2. Do you hear negative feedback in public and conflicts between colleagues (or is there backstabbing)?
  3. Do teammates stop and report backstabbing (or tacitly collude against supervisors and the entire team)?
  4. Do teammates accept feedback (or prefer to defend themselves with excuses)?
  5. Can most of the teammates tell the founders the estimated value of their stock options?
  6. Is there a competition between champions in their profession to get on the last seat in the rocket?

Are you confident to check mark all of the above while you have a lack of exponential word of mouth growth?

Comfort is Suicide 

Wartime Principles 
Comfort is Suicide

I still treasure the memories of our village kids gang mates.

One early morning, we tossed stones at Serge's window to wake him up for a fishing trip. Serge, who lived in the block next to mine, was six years my senior. I can still picture his face and hands, the ones that taught me how to hook a fish. We both ended up falling into the water, but we were proud to show off our trophy fish to the gang and my grandmother. Serge cared for me like an older brother, even though we weren't related. After that, I never saw him again.

22 years later, Serge shoot himself in the head with his grandfather’s gun, staring out of the same window we used to throw stones at to wake him up for fishing.

What could he have possibly seen in that window that drove him to such despair at the age of 35?

Serge was a brilliant individual, having graduated with summa cum laude honors from a top math faculty at MSU. He moved to the U.S. to teach maths at Boston University. At 25, he returned home for a holiday and stayed at his countryside home, or 'dacha'. He was supposed to fly back to the U.S. in a few weeks, but he never boarded that flight. Instead, he chose to stay with his girlfriend, enjoying the comfort of his dacha and the peaceful songs of century-old pine trees.

I believe that after seven years, Serge began to yearn for his career. He was a born champion, destined to change the world, but he realized he had lost his chance to do so. He didn't lose it in a competition, but in the comfort of his dacha. His champion spirit, encoded in trillions of brain connections, couldn't find an answer to the question, "Did you do your best to change the world?"

I've seen this scenario play out many times. Some people didn't have a gun, so they turned to vodka and drugs. You reach 35, look back at your life, and see the wrong answers to the question. Who you are is defined by what you do to answer Ben's question.

Ben saw Alex in the window.

Over that summer holiday, Serge's Ben retreated to Alex. But Ben can't die. Ben has survived and evolved over billions of years to create humankind. Each generation, Ben gives birth to a better Ben under the star blast pressure of market competition. If the next Ben is born, all Alexes make way for a better life. All past Bens are Alexes destined to fade with a window glimpse.

The program for the next Ben's birth is in everyone, as we are all past Bens. However, it only self-activates in a fraction of the population. This program is the question, "Did you do your best to try to change the world?" Once activated, it can't be forgotten.

If you're reading this, it means the question was asked. The program to spearhead evolution was activated. We are the Ben giving birth to the next Ben.

You can't suppress your nature, and there's no reason to. You can't kill your Ben and live as an Alex. Ben has survived billions of years to create us. Ben is life in the universe. He can't stop asking, "Did you do your best to try to change the world?"

If Ben stops, life in the universe is dead.

Constructive Сonflict

  12:30 PM

Constructive conflict for Committed decisions, Accountability and Results. Today’s Pitching team dispute if we should put investors manually both in Airtable and Strapi resulted in a decision to remove Airtable as a burden. While parsed data should be uploaded to Strapi directly. A CRM will be implemented in the future and be connected with Strapi (or other platform solution). The conflict resulted in the decision which teammates want to commit to. That is a classic example of productive conflict from top management book Five Dysfunctions of a Team. Fear of such conflicts results in mediocre decisions, Lack of Commitment, Lack of Accountability and Results.

PS. Beware that the book is criticised for lack of robust data:

“For example, when the trust level among team members is low, Lencioni recommends that leaders put them through a series of personal disclosures. However, there is little likelihood that these activities can build trust in dysfunctional work teams. According to Katzenbach and Smith, the only effective method for teams to build trust and cohesion is to do real work,[6]

Performance is key to creating teams. A company with “high performance standards” is likelier to create high-performance teams than a company that simply teaches teamwork…. Teams function best when they can depend on their leaders to set clear standards and create dependable, supportive processes. 

 Jon R. Katzenbach, McKinsey 1993

That is why we demand performance and conflicts to build trust rather than worshiping on fake team work and  polite rituals. #nakedmanagement

Put the principles from paper to the muscles.

The Shocking Rules 

The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future 
The Shame of Ambition on Feet of Clay Culture

I was shocked  by  Dmitry's question yesterday…

.. and, instead of answering, started to mumble something else (the pattern I publicly penalise - we should answer questions we were asked).The question was “Can I join Liberta discussions”.

My answer was something “We tested LA airdrop and get hundreds of thousands registrations.”Later I was thinking, why I violated the rule to answer what was asked? Such mistake costed me position to lead utilities equity research of EMEA region at Goldman Sachs 13 years ago in London. I become just a 2nd candidate to this role after final interview. I realised that I felt 2 shocks when heard Dmitry:

1. A developer was interested to look outside of the code to learn about use case and clients. Just a day before I was asked publicly “why a developer should be distracted from coding with Sprint meetup?”

The Dmitry’s question was a shocking contrast to some the shitty patterns of our current culture:

* “I am not in charge of clients and results, so it is someone fails, not me. I solve hard problems to grow skills and cv value to resell it in a year.”
* “I do not use product I build. I do not want to see these failures.”
* “Making my results and responsibility transparent with OKRs is a waste of time. We should sabotage with poorly defined metrics”.
* “I am not in charge of hiring and growing teammates. I want lower the bar to feel comfort and have no successors who can replace me. So I can bargain comfort zone and CEO can not force me to use the product I build, make my results transparent, be accountable for results/critical hits, develop team and raise successors or read books.”
* “I do not read condensed experience from top leaders in my profession. I prefer to feel smart myself, bargain and protect status quo.”
* “I will prove that a task is undoable, and will help others to prove that their tasks are not doable, so we can help each other to protect comfort zone. That is how I find friends quickly.”  Take a shitty example from today’s breakfast: “I done my research: We cant get a response from top tokens for co-marketing”



2. Second shock is that I feel ashamed to talk about Liberta while having the culture outlined above. So I started to mumble something to prove that I am not crazy with the Liberta project. I said “We tested LA airdrop and get hundreds of thousands registrations.”

Can we win the war of programs for computer memory, when we have failed programs in brains memory? If one can avoid responsibility by faking a proof that task is undoable. If her lie is covered by those who also want to lower the bar and bargain comfort zone. That are shitty programs doomed to fail longterm. However are strong, due to immediate benefits to the mediocre people. Do not tolerate lowering the bar and mediocre performance.The only reason why I am here is to put financial life at fingertips with the project like Liberta. To help people to use money to bring their ideas into life and be stakeholders of the future they build with their ideas.

* Libra, TON, digital yuan and dollar made a billion people craving a stable currency unpegged from central banks. We can make it happen: available everywhere, and stable with a decentralised monetary policy targeting inflation. LIBERTA countdown c.60 Days.
* Objective: Liberta people with stable unpegged currency at fingertips for every corner of internet.
* Key Result: 1 m daily active users, spreading the greatest currency and products to fingertips.
* Future value of the currency could be used to pay early adopters to make this future happen.



Impediments to overcome: 

* FIAT DEPOSIT attempt should grow to 50% from 1%. So we hook L airdroppers  with actual daily use case. We have 800 attempts per day with 8 successes. @arkon @dk
* VIRALITY of B2B airdrops should hit >1. And Liberta page with Davos board well prepared @Alexander Kotin
* LACHAIN. Liberta should be transferrable in LACHAIN so people have trust to spur virality, we get nodes and blockchain users. @Dmitry Ivashchenko
* SCALABILITY. We should test and prepare product for 10 000 realtime active users with 10k orders sent to order book in a second. @ds
* CULTURE of accountability for result. Get rid of blurred mediocracy polishing her cv and comfort, embrace those who dare to have a vision and responsibility for that.

So, Dmitry I finally the answer to your question is: Yes, you can discuss over Growth standups and/or please set up the Liberta Task-Forces_suS-N#_luv9- with Alexander for weekly catch ups to assault impediments.Heavy checkmark if you have read it;)

Set up reminder to read it later on evening. 




Get Shit Done or Raise The Bar Rule

The Get Shit Done sign on the Revolut office wall illuminate the reason why Revolut went so far from 0 to c.$9 billion valuation.

If one proves to others that a task is undoable, her has less responsibility and more friends cooperating to avoid effort and replicate this shit pattern. So others have to get this shit done.

Excuse seekers prove to others why they do not need to do an extra effort and get out of comfort to make a critical hit. So they have spare time and energy to protect their status quo agains other teammates those who are focusing to get things done. Thus teammates have not only to get things done but also have shit done produced by excuse seekers. Shit is a habit to avoid responsibility and collude to do so against other teammates.

Do you keep silence when someone is tweaking facts, inventing or selecting data to prove that a task is undoable? 

Get rid of this shit. React immediately, do not a silent part of such shit. Raise the Bar.

Leverage The Principles: Olympics of Freedom and Responsibility to Build the Future 



Instinctively I do want recognition, higher titles, salary, influence and want less responsibility and effort. So I have higher risk adjusted ROI on my effort. If I do not measure the result for clients and do not take responsibility for that then the value for clients is not in my ROI formula. Of course I use energy only on variables in my ROI formula: recognition, titles, salary, influence.. No client metrics here. And I feel demotivated if I do not get recognition etc for consulting teammates and jumping around, I feel tensions of normal and median people. That is the lack of commitment and accountability well described in theFive dysfunctions of teams.  Constructive Сonflict

Win your inner war of the Past and the Future to save life in  the universe

If you colonize another planet - you just double the surface. If you have spread blockchain, it is like  you colonised 10 planets. Because you magnified all people’s power by 10x as blockchain transfers value where political power fails.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iktqfNoLI4E

Today Ayman Sayed showed us his weekend hackathon delivery - the message from president and billionaires to those who really change the planet. The message to empower the hero in our teammates. Each day, everybody has a tough inner battle between 2 characters. One is the glimpse of the future - visionary achiever Ben and another is the sofa army of past - comfort seeking mediocracy Alex.

Ben makes Critical hits while getting done shit produced by Alex.

Ben raises the bar and attracts into team those who is stronger than himself to expand the glimpse of the future.

Alex raises shit - fake work, and friends helping to raise awareness that tasks are undoable and thus Alexes are not accountable.

Alex attracts even weaker Alexes to spread their shit together and protect their comfort zone instead of making extra efforts. 

Alex wants team to get weaker to bargain his comfort and avoid being replaced by a Ben. While Alex waits Ben to create value to free ride some of it. 

Alex tries to prove that Ben does not have the glimpse of the future, no future, no vision of it. Alex want to preserve his comfort past and blur the glimpse of the future.  

Alex wants to avoid being replaced by a Ben. He does not want future to replace past.

Ben - you know from the president and billionaires that our market is the next internet of value, built on top of internet of information.

Ben - you know that we learned how to spread the technology and our app. This means we are not crazy to dream to change planet while been Alexes. This means part of our team has evolved into Ben and grow in power to really change the planet.

Ben: defeat your Alex now. You have little time to be a part of the opportunity. Become Ben to be one of us to change the planet and force Alexes to copy us and evolve.

It is not easy. Alexes around you tie you to be one of them with their social gravity of rituals and norms helping them to kill time till death in comfort zone.

You should defeat Alexes in yourself and Alexes around so they are forced to evolve into your Ben. That is the force of natural and economic selection. That is how the best part of you evolve through generation and live forever to spread life through entropy.  

Comfort means Alex defeat Ben. It means Past defeat the Future. 

Life and evolution is under threat. Surround yourself with people getting you out of comfort and making you growing. Get out of comfort NOW.

Be Defenceless to be Strong 
Punish Agents to Reward Principals

We started the day from a case of the PRINCIPAL behaviour.

Yaroslav showed how he put his new landing design into web for AB testing overnight at Sat hackathon. He made it  overnight and saved 50 days of 5 people interacting to put his design into Jira, sprint, qa, prod.

That is 100-2500x performance of medium people.   :rocket:

PRINCIPAL maximises stocks value with 100-2500x performance.  AGENT is a theft of your stock option. Here is how.

XXX - the project manager responsible for processes automation does not follow scrum stories rules and seems to be unaware how to write them.

Maybe our Story page is unclear?

Wait, he had not checkmarked that he read this page.

Hm, a person responsible to automate onboarding ignore onboarding into operations processes.The Stories is a cornerstone of the Scrum as the Who needs Why for What format ensure transparency what teammates do and, most of all increase chance that they understand what they do. Without a clear story, teammates can not understand what other teammates are doing and train the habit to waste time, pretend to understand. Standards are getting lower. They are turning into dumb zombies with each sprint time.

Agents are very happy to have things blurred and dumb people to hide their fake work.

Our single advantage over big companies with army of clients, professionals and money is a greater opportunity to solve the principal-agent problem.

As a principal, you must make agency behaviour punished before it became Nash stable strategy in your unit, and habit wired into your brain. That is how you win the award - stunning colleagues empowering your growth to build great things, successful clients and your stock option growing to real millions USD.

Small theft by saving  own time and effort at expense of  big damage to the culture and teammates future should not be tolerated.

Olga transfer XXX unvested stock options to those who checkmarked the rules.

PS. Principal-agent problem is a cornerstone to understand team performance. It is a part of contract and mechanism design theories - 5 Nobel Awards in economics: Arrow 1972, Muskin 2006, Hart & Holmstrom 2016, Milgrom 2020. Learn now.

Fire good ones for freedom

First week: star-blast pressure to filter out mediocracy   
Long Hour Rule

“Let’s work less and smarter to be productive.”

One developer said and went home early. 

The real reason was not his fatigue after coding complex things. The real reason was his freelance project. Each evening he resold what he learned from teammates and earned 2x more than teammates. His mediocre performance was not a big problem itself. The problem was the conflict of interests.

Some colleagues felt friction with the team goals and pointed to our principles. So he needed to protect his lucrative status quo and started a tacit war against the principles. He started backtalk to solicit others to violate Code of Ethics and the Principles. He said the Principles are slavery, and the company do not follow them. Now, his work become to explain others why loyal teammates and company are immoral and deserves to be cheated.

Those who wanted more comfort quickly become his friends to avoid responsibility and hard work. Here is a team maximizing their benefits and minimizing efforts and risks to be fired. They had 2 lives - one was to show to others about hard problems they struggle to solve which none can understand with blurred stories. And another life was messing code and gossips against loyal to the company colleagues. They had strong incentives to sabotage interviews and newcomers to ensure they are irreplaceable.

They were proud of their ability to take advantage over the company. They felt like: Now, the company is the slave and we are the rules.

So we have the Long hour rule and we fire for failure to report on a conflict of interests or backtalk/gossips.

THE LONG HOURS RULE

We work long hours and often over weekends. Why one would work short hours?

* ether is not committed to change the world with a product or
* have a side project and conflict of interest

 

Here is how Long hour rule detect the conflict early at the onboarding process:

Scrum Rules

Русская версия: Правила Скрама 

LATOKEN Scrum Rules



Standups are assaults on impediments, targeting critical hits modeled by Stories and Snippets that connect projects into the Model of the Backlog. Standups and grooming must recheck and reinforce these rules to ensure projects reinforce each other and critical tasks execute the modeled vision.




1. Grooming to Model

Structure: Projects and tasks must be MECE Pyramid grouped. Add new tasks to relevant parent projects to ensure the integrity of the backlog model and clarity of the context to the doer.

Snippets: Detail projects and tasks to show how they connect into a self-reinforcing model.

Ownership: Everyone must grow to own a significant project which makes a big sense as they see how it reinforce the entire model (vision).  



2. Task/Project Definitions

→ verifiable naming rechecked by the story and detailed by vision. 

Verifiable Naming: Task name must make it clear how to verify if task is done or not.   Examples: “Show Score in Profile” – Verifiable as it is easy to check if the score is shown or not. “Seamless hiring process automation” – Not verifiable as judgement on the adjective “seamless” is vague and subgective.

Task NAME = WHAT in the Story format Who needs WHAT for Why.

Vision: Larger projects must outline the user journey step-by-step in a novel style.

ToDos: Break tasks into 1–2 hour superconcrete actionable subtasks.

Supportive Materials: Attach screenshots, links, and resources to ensure clarity.



3. Tasks must Focus on The Critical Hit 

Tasks must laserfocus sufficient effort to solve micro-problems unlocking significant business value. Modelling the tasks into the backlog model is essential to figure out which task enables many other projects to release a decent value.




4. Execution: Demo or Die

 Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 10.54.11 PM.png

Monthly/Weekly: Add tasks from the backlog to your Monthly or Weekly and deliver to prod ready for demo. Demo in prod or Die means you leave no room for excuses; instead, you must get out of comfort to figure out how to create value.

Reports: Include key metrics linking your tasks to business value. Highlight blockers.



Daily Standups: Assault on blockers

Share Screen: All participants must share screens with yesterday and today tasks added to a Standup project, so it is clear how many hours spend on each task in work and what is the progress.  

Report:

1. What did I do yesterday?

2. What do I plan to do today?

3. What are the blockers?

CheckFix Reports: Post before standups to prioritize critical issues.

If the task is unclear or breaches the rules - request to improve loudly! Silence is a tacit collusion to undermine the rules - even worse than the mistake itself.



6. Cultural Reinforcements



Make Accountable: Mistakes or bugs must be fixed ASAP by the person who created the bug - demand it!

Punish Excuse-seeking: Point on any attempts to self-excuse (eg. “I do not show a demo as someone did not pull my code to prod”,  your reaction: “So you choose to seek excuse, instead of chasing to pull to prod or escalating to team-wide breakfast.”).

Hiding mistakes is crime: Its starts from "spinning" - hiding information, rapidly growing to habit to spread fakes to mislead entire team into beliefs paralyzing any progress.

No Task Jumping:  Insist to get a task done before taking another. Jumping is frequently used to avoid an effort and accountability needed for actual delivery, while creating a sense of lots of (fake)work done.  

Test as a user: Get to prod and try, emphathize to clients and help him to achieve success without friction.

Onboard intensively to these rules: Resist the temptation to weaponize newcomers to weaken the rules. Be exceptionally demanding from day one.




There will be pressures to break these rules to serve individual interests, but discipline is essential to keep everyone aligned and transparent. Without this, freeriding and excuse-seeking will prevail, eroding our culture to the point where our children might be better off growing up in a disciplined Chinese orphanage to learn a winning culture. Make the uncomfortable strategy to step out of your comfort zone, take full responsibility, grow, and deliver results the winning one!





МУТНЫЕ ЗАДАЧИ = УВОЛЬНЯЕМ 

—

Jeff Sutherland, author of  Scrum:



“Planning for Vision and visibility of your progress is everything; plans are worthless.”

https://youtu.be/s4thQcgLCqk?t=170
Yes, he needed to see how his friend was shot by a missile to figure out the Scrum Rules and avoid his fate. Imminent threat to existence is the most innovative force. 



  
МУТНЫЕ ЗАДАЧИ = УВОЛЬНЯЕМ

 

Иван уволен, так как Петя систематически не выполняет свои обязанности по контролю соблюдения правил структурирования задач Ивана и новичков-подчиненных. Как следствие Иван запутывается и не справляется с задачами, помощь ему увязает в попытках распутать его формулировки.
Вместо выполнения своих обязанностей Петя молчаливо одобряет нарушения, что затрудняет их исправление, создает неприемлемо высокие издержки на найм и онбординг новичков. Возникает вопрос: зачем нам тогда найм и хакатоны? Чтобы использовать новичков для торпедирования культуры прозрачности задач?

Основные нарушения правил:

 1. Название задачи должно быть проверяемым: из названия должно быть понятно, выполнена задача или нет. Примеры:
 • Проверяемое: Score to Profile – можно проверить, появился ли скор в профиле.
 • Непроверяемое: Seamless hiring process automation – слово “Seamless” является субъективной оценкой, не поддающейся объективной проверке.
 2. Название задачи = WHATиз User Story формата Who needs WHAT for Why.
 3. Видение задачи должно описываться как пошаговый путь пользователя (для крупных проектов).
 4. Отсутствие прогрумленного “Father” беклога и родительского проекта у задачи.
Это мешает новичкам понять контекст задачи, из-за чего они совершают ошибки, забывают задачи и не становятся овнерами значимых проектов. В результате — низкая мотивация и превращение команды в деградирующую “раковую опухоль“.

 5. Задачи проекта должны соответствовать его сниппету.
Из названия проекта должно быть понятно, какие задачи в нем находятся, а задачи должны перепроверять разумность и целостность проекта.

 6. Задача должна быть критическим попаданием: это должно быть снайперское решение микро-проблемы минимальными усилиями, которое разблокирует значительную бизнес-ценность.

Пример нарушения:

На скриншоте видно, как Петя молчаливо одобряет нарушение Иваном всех шести правил.

а) Цепочка нарушений начинается с Несоответствия сниппета задачам проекта:
Сниппет “Onboarding: Test to GF AI. Score to Profile.” предполагает выполнение двух задач: Test to GF AI и Score to Profile.
Вместо добавления задачи Score to Profile, Петя позволяет включить Seamless hiring process automation, что уже нарушает правило 5.
б) Это, в свою очередь, провоцирует нарушение остальных правил:
 • Вместо фокуса на критическом попадании (правило 6), указанного СЕО,  Иван дефокусируется на бессмысленно сформулированном несогласованном проекте.
 • Нарушение правила 1 (непроверяемое название задачи) запускает цепную реакцию остальных нарушений.

Последствия:

Команда на завтраке опять не смогла понять задачи Ивана (например Саша не смог) и оказалась в ситуации, где необходимо было выбирать:

 1. Продолжать делегировать контроль задач новичков на СЕО, что делает стендапы бессмысленными, так как лиды больше не отвечают за контроль задач.
 2. Прекратить найм, чтобы минимизировать издержки от подобных нарушений.
 3. Изменить статус-кво и побудить лидов контролировать задачи новичков.

Решение:

Мой выбор 3 = увольнение Ивана, которое становится орудием для торга с Петей о том, кто должен контролировать задачи новичков.

Петя может заплатить штраф в размере $500, чтобы отменить это решение. Однако этот штраф будет повторен при любом следующем нарушении пунктов 1-6 со стороны Ивана, незамеченным и не исправленным Петей.  
Правила Скрама

Ежедневные стендапы – это атаки на препятствия, нацеленные на критические задачи, смоделированные через Stories и Snippets, которые соединяют проекты в Модель Бэклога. Стендапы и груминг должны пересматривать и укреплять эти правила, чтобы гарантировать, что проекты усиливают друг друга, а критические задачи выполняют смоделированное видение.




1. Груминг проектов это моделирование будущего

• Структура: Проекты и задачи должны быть сгруппированы по принципу MECE Pyramid. Новые задачи добавляются в соответствующие родительские проекты, чтобы сохранить целостность модели бэклога и обеспечить ясность контекста для исполнителя.

• Снипеты: Раскрывайте детали проектов и задач, чтобы показать, как они соединяются в самоукрепляющуюся модель.

• Владение: Каждый должен стремиться взять на себя значимый проект, который имеет большой смысл, и видеть, как он усиливает всю модель (видение).




2. Определение Задач/Проектов

→ Проверяемое название, проверенное через Сторю и детализированное через Видение.

• Проверяемое именование: Название задачи должно ясно показывать, как проверить, выполнена задача или нет.

• Пример: «Показать счет в профиле» – Проверяемо, так как легко проверить, отображается ли счет.

• Пример: «Бесшовная автоматизация процесса найма» – Непроверяемо, так как оценка слова «бесшовная» субъективна и расплывчата.

• Название задачи = ЧТО в формате истории Who needs WHAT for Why.

• Видение: Пошаговый путь пользователя в оригинальном стиле (для проектов > 12 часов).

• ToDos: Разбейте задачи на конкретные подзадачи, выполнимые за 1–2 часа.

• Сопроводительные материалы: Присоединяйте скриншоты, ссылки и ресурсы для обеспечения ясности.




3. Задачи должны фокусироваться на критическом попадании




Задачи должны быть направлены на решение микро-проблем с достаточными усилиями, чтобы разблокировать значительную бизнес-ценность. Моделирование задач в структуре бэклога необходимо, чтобы определить, какая задача позволяет разблокировать множество других проектов и обеспечить значительный результат.




Исполнение: Demo or Die

Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 10.54.11 PM.png



Ежемесячно/Еженедельно: Добавляйте задачи из бэклога в ежемесячные или еженедельные планы и доводите их до готовности к демонстрации в продакшене. Demo in prod or Die означает отсутствие оправданий; вместо этого вы должны выйти из зоны комфорта и найти способ создать ценность.



Отчеты: Включайте ключевые метрики, связывающие ваши задачи с бизнес-ценностью. Выделяйте блокеры.



Ежедневные стендапы: Атака на блокеры



Демонстрация экрана: Все участники должны делиться экранами с добавленными задачами за вчерашний и сегодняшний день в проект стендапа. Это должно показывать, сколько времени потрачено на каждую задачу и каков прогресс.

Отчет:

1. Что я сделал вчера?

2. Что я планирую сделать сегодня?

3. Какие блокеры?

CheckFix Reports: Публикуйте перед стендапами, чтобы расставить приоритеты для критических проблем.



Если задача неясна или нарушает правила — запросите улучшение громко! Молчание — это молчаливый сговор, подрывающий правила, что даже хуже самой ошибки.




Культурные усиления



Привлечение к ответственности: Ошибки или баги должны быть исправлены как можно быстрее тем, кто их создал — требуйте этого!

Наказание за оправдания: Указывайте на любые попытки самооправдания (например, «Я не показываю демо, потому что кто-то не перенес мой код в продакшен», ваш ответ: «Значит, ты решил искать оправдания вместо того, чтобы добиться переноса в продакшен или поднять вопрос на командном завтраке»).

Сокрытие ошибок — это преступление: Это начинается с “перевирания” фактов и быстро перерастает в привычку распространять ложь, вводя команду в заблуждение и парализуя прогресс.

Никаких прыжков между задачами: Добейтесь завершения задачи, прежде чем брать другую. Прыжки между задачами часто используются, чтобы избежать усилий и ответственности за реальную реализацию, создавая иллюзию большого объема (фиктивной) работ

Тестируйте как пользователь: Протестируйте задачу в продакшене, поставьте себя на место клиента и помогите ему достичь успеха без трений.

Интенсивное внедрение этих правил: Сопротивляйтесь искушению ослабить правила для новичков. Будьте крайне требовательны с первого дня.




Будут существовать давления, чтобы нарушить эти правила в угоду личным интересам, но дисциплина необходима для сохранения прозрачности и выравнивания команды. Без этого свободное поведение и оправдания будут доминировать, разрушая нашу культуру до такой степени, что нашим детям будет лучше вырасти в дисциплинированном китайском приюте, чтобы освоить культуру победителей. Сделайте стратегию выхода из зоны комфорта, принятия полной ответственности, роста и достижения результатов выигрышной!

Привлечение к ответственности: Ошибки или баги должны быть исправлены как можно быстрее тем, кто их создал — требуйте этого!

Наказание за оправдания: Указывайте на любые попытки самооправдания (например: «Я не показываю демо, потому что кто-то не перенес мой код в продакшен». Ваш ответ: «То есть, ты предпочел искать оправдания, вместо того чтобы добиться переноса в продакшен или поднять вопрос на командном завтраке?»).

Сокрытие ошибок — это преступление: Это начинается с “перекручивания” информации и быстро превращается в привычку распространять ложь, вводя команду в заблуждение и парализуя прогресс.

Никаких прыжков между задачами: Настаивайте на завершении одной задачи, прежде чем брать другую. Прыжки между задачами часто используются для избегания усилий и ответственности, необходимых для реальной реализации, создавая лишь иллюзию большого объема (фиктивной) работы.

Тестируйте как пользователь: Доведите задачу до продакшена и протестируйте её. Поставьте себя на место клиента и помогите ему достичь успеха без лишних сложностей.

Интенсивное внедрение этих правил: Сопротивляйтесь искушению использовать новичков как оружие чтобы разрушить эти правила. Будьте максимально требовательны с первого дня.




Будут существовать давления, чтобы нарушить эти правила в угоду личным интересам, но дисциплина необходима для того, чтобы команда оставалась согласованной и прозрачной. Без этого доминировать будут свободное поведение и оправдания, разрушая нашу культуру до такой степени, что нашим детям будет лучше вырасти в дисциплинированном китайском приюте, чтобы освоить культуру победителей. Сделайте стратегию выхода из зоны комфорта, принятия полной ответственности, роста и достижения результатов выигрышной!



МУТНЫЕ ЗАДАЧИ = УВОЛЬНЯЕМ

Джефф Сазерленд, автор Scrum:




“Планирование для видения и видимости вашего прогресса — это всё; планы бесполезны.”

Да, ему нужно было увидеть, как его друга сбил ракетный удар, чтобы понять правила Scrum и избежать подобной судьбы. Угроза существованию — самая инновационная сила.
Scrum Rules

Scrum master leverages ClickUp stories (Jira), Coda OKRs, stand-ups, sprints to help the team see the road to the mission, overcome impediments and move faster. 

The master never wastes the team's time to educate it. They help from the first minute with the Scrum method. 



Meet Jeff Sutherland, the author of Scrum:

“Planning for Vision and visibility of your progress is everything, plans are worthless”

https://youtu.be/s4thQcgLCqk?t=170 

Yes, he needed to see how his friend was shot by a missile to figure out scrum and avoid his fate. Imminent threat to existence is the most innovative force. 

Btw thanks to this force we figured out how to make this page.

Learn now, before you get shot to educate others.

Scrum Master’s Rules

Scrum Masters plant the culture as Hiring Managers

Be a visionary achiever and lead us with Unit Mission, OKRs, Stories, Stand-ups, Sprints and Retro or Grooming.



Run Check-In/Stand Ups

1. Start and finish on time (15 min). 
2. Everybody should tell:  
  1. What have I done yesterday?
  2. What do I plan to do today?
  3. What are impediments to overcome?



Ensure stand-up is an assault on impediments, not a formal, vague fuck off. 

* Ask to share screen and show ClickUp tasks in the Results ClickUp table to ensure that tasks are aligned with the OKRs.
* Check if tasks are prioritised according to Backlog priorities.



Note: If it’s unclear what a teammate does - ask him!

If you see someone is not getting things done - tell it and ask to read and comply with the Principles or speak up at the breakfast or to supervisor and via 360 form.

Facilitate Sprints and Friday Retro or Grooming

1. Stories are Who needs What for Why. That makes tasks crystal clear.
2. Start on time. If zoom is busy with another team, ask them to move out.
3. Demo or Die Rule. Ask to show Demo: teammates must show a valuable outcome from sprint.
4. Ask teammates to report whether tasks are done or not. Fill in the completion number.
5. Ensure Sprint stories are prioritised according to the Backlog ranking.
6. Launch a new Sprint with a doable pile of well prioritised stories. Sprint completion below 80% is a fail.
7. Ensure mistakes or bugs are fixed ASAP by a person who created the bug.
8. Prevent attempts to shift responsibility or hide mistakes or cover each other instead of challenging yourself to grow.

Keep Coda Backlog priorities, OKRs and Click up updated

1. Ensure Backlog priorities are crystal clear, up to date and aligned with OKRs. 
  1. Description contains a Story Who/What/Why. 
  2. Screenshots with samples are attached.
  3. Every teammate voted/followed up to 4 features.
2. Ensure Click up stories are:
  1. Aligned and prioritized to hit priority features from Backlog Ranking priorities.
  2. Aimed at Key Results.
  3. Doable within sprint with a demo, and clear to a grandma: [Who] needs [What] because [Why].
3. Eliminate waste: 
  1. Fuck poor priorities.
  2. Inventory of 99% finished and not working for business features - that is a crime.

Grow team (advanced)

1. Be hiring manager and raise the bar with every hire, remove those who lower the bar.
2. Ensure each newcomer has a buddy, is well onboarded with company wide quizzes, unit Manuals and tasks tests.
3. Run Saturday Hackathon.
4. The Principles and shocking rules must work.
5. Make weekly zoom with clients.
6. Evaluate 360 feedback and Do 1-1s.
7. Encourage CAN DO attitude, taking responsibility and reveal own mistakes. Acknowledge your mistakes.
8. Ensure your successor is appointed and trained, announce him on Friday (if applicable).

  
HR referral program

The goal of the program 

A significant share of the teammates joins international top-tier tech companies and startups via referral programs. At LATOKEN, we developed a similar program that benefits both the company (the skills of referred people are usually higher) and current teammates (earn a referral bonus & work with people you know who are skilled and professional). So, A-players attract A-players.

Process

1) A teammate referring a candidate should send the candidate’s CV to #referral_program with mentioning the candidates' professional sphere/vacancy applied.

2) Talent manager process each referral in 10 days and provides with feedback in comment below the post.

3) If all the conditions described in this policy are met, approval for the referral bonus should be given by Remuneration Committee (RemCom).

Reward amounts

Top-level: 4 000 USD

Roles: C-Level, Head of Mega Unit

Senior-level: 2 000 USD

Roles: Director, Lead developer, Lead/Head of subunit, Senior developer/manager, PO (Product owner) 

Middle level: 1 000 USD

Middle developer, Senior manager

Junior-level: 500 USD

Analyst, Manager

Conditions

* Effective 01.12.2021.
* The current program covers full-time roles only.
* The referred teammate should have worked for 90 calendar days (3 months) and be transferred in CRM to the stage Hired - Closed Won.
* Referral bonus is paid in two equal parts, consecutively, during the first and second month after the referred teammate is transferred in CRM to the stage Hired - Closed Won (and confirmation from RemCo received).
* CEO, HR, and Leads/Heads of a unit (where the candidate is being referred) are not eligible to participate in the Hiring Referral Program.
* Head of Unit can participate in the program if referring the candidate to another Mega unit, and this candidate is not in HR CRM (has not been previously contacted by LATOKEN HR).
* Relatives can be referred to LATOKEN.
* If you referred a candidate (-s) between 08.04.2021 (when the CEO first announced the referral program) and 01.12.2021 and complied with all the requirements mentioned here, please apply through and attach a screenshot where you were sending candidates' CV to HR. Referral bonus, in this case, will be paid in two equal parts, consecutively, during the first and second months.

Platform Operations Specification

Teammates need a platform to manage operations with well defined roles, functions, tasks and OKRs which are easy to keep updated. This will enable us to scale 140+ remote team as teammates are accountable for well prioritised deliveries.

Manage Units, Roles and Functions

Unit leads need an easy interface to make clear who is responsible for what and keep it updated. In other words, what are the Roles and Functions, what are their OKRs and Tasks. So HRBPs are clear whom to look for, what to ask on interviews, what to post into Vacancy and Job offers. Candidates understand what they will do and if it is the best match for their skills and career path. Newcomers are easy to onboard and teammates are sure who execute what.

Drag and drop in a hierarchy table:

* Role to any unit
* Function to any Role
* Task to any function in any unit

Type to see related function or task, reuse or copy it and edit to create new.

Teammates want updated and relevant daily checklists of relevant tasks to check if they done important tasks. So we are sure processes are working well, can be reviewed for automation and delegated.

Teammates want to give feedback and be able to update checklist tasks (TBA by Unit lead and reviewed by Operations managers).

360 Reviews

Teammates want to a realtime 360 form to give and receive feedback needed to improve performance. Can we add it to slack or zoom, so it is at fingertips after significant interaction with a person.

Job Offers

HRBPs wants to sync Role functions with Vacancies and Offers to keep them updated and laser focused.

What and why we do

Imagine entire financial life in one app. Anywhere in the world, anybody can open a profoundly greater account for payments, investing or fundraising. We erase borders and open the world full of opportunities illuminated by financial freedom.  

Today, LATOKEN is a top exchange with the largest in the world primary market for blockchain startups' digital assets with 150+ Initial Exchange Offerings. 

Modern Primary and secondary markets for equity and other assets manage the allocation of planetary resources: shape incentives, goals,  values, and culture of billions of people to maximize capitalization (future profits) of the economy.  The capital markets is a leapfrog in social evolution that resulted in a 50x boost of economic growth since the late 1800th from historical 0.06% to 3.5% pa. It is comparable to the emergence of a neural system communicating with cells via electric signals instead of slow chains of chemical reactions.

Venture Capital and startups are the spearhead of the capital markets and mankind's evolution. Fantastic ideas from books and movies once read in childhood are built into products and new life for people here. 

A fantastic idea turns into greater reality after hundreds of hypothesis tests to find a team-product-market-timing fit. This requires investments and at least 100x productivity to US average people and 2000x to the performance of people from countries with less developed cultural and legal infrastructure. Such productivity is achievable via constant growth driven by: feedback loops, an inflow of great talent and culture (focusing on clients by solving the free-rider, asymmetry of information, attribution error problems). 

The traditional way of fundraising via introductions of angels and VC fund managers was recently a better option for high-quality startups. So they did not go for IEOs. Coupled with a lack of regulation, this enforced the negative selection and a vicious circle: lack of investable startups - lack of qualified investors - lack of investable startups - lack of qualified investors. As a result of the infant stage of the market, we explicitly state in weekly emails mentioning listings, that we do not recommend for investments or give investment advice regarding startups listed on the platform. Startups are informed in order forms, that we do not market them to our users and that they should not expect successful fundraise just because they are listed. Initial Exchange Offering (crowdfunding/primary market) is given as a complementary feature for free to the secondary listing.

Coronavirus quarantines and shocks for economic activity cut high-quality startups from traditional VCs.  VCs are de-risking and are dry of cash as can not call capital from Limited Partners.

Agile startups can rescue the economy with new products and ways of life in the era of the pandemic but they are cut from the capital and lay off teammates.

That is our opportunity to give them access to new types of  VC investors: top managers and high net worth individuals - those who have both money and expertise about client pains and tech.

VCTV, mix of Netflix and Bloomberg for VC entrepreneurs and investors, solves the problem of online roadshows needed to connect non-blockchain startups with non-blockchain investors. 
Capital Markets Manage the Planet

Capital markets align actions of people with future prosperity via markets price transmission: contagion of price changes from capital markets to product, labour, education, dating markets etc. Goal of life is to increase Nasdaq index.

Screenshot 2020-09-18 at 12.53.22.png

The capital markets optimize the allocation of planetary resources to maximize return on investments which means maximize capitalization.  It shapes the incentives, goals,  values, and culture of billions of people to maximize capitalization (future profits) of the economy.  The capital markets is a leapfrog in social evolution that resulted in a 50x boost of economic growth since the late 1800th from historical 0.06% to 3.5% pa. It is comparable to the emergence of a neural system communicating with cells via electric signals instead of slow chains of chemical reactions.

The modern global machine is mainly built on protected property rights and free markets, enforced by political machines based on competition between politicians and media to get the majority vote. These mean market economy where incentives are delivered via prices through interrelated markets. Price contagion or price transmission from capital markets across assets into product, labor, education and even dating markets optimize incentives for billions of people to feel and do something useful for capitalization.

Venture Capital and startups are the spearhead of the capital markets and mankind evolution. Fantastic ideas from books and movies once read in childhood are built into products and new life for people here. 

Both prosperity and recession have roots n the capital markets (except covid perhaps). Errors of traders destroy billions and institutions built for centuries.

Yes, you are getting it right: capital markets jobs are about exceptional accuracy, performance, creativity and discipline.

Goal of Life

Life is an execution of a program using energy to build storage and other infrastructure for itself out of entropy. Programs that use energy poorly are erased by natural and economical selection in competition for limited sources of energy (such as clients’ money). Thus the goal of the program is to use energy in a way that will enable it to use more energy in the future. Simply because  programs with other goals are erased by programs with this goal. That is not necessary about conscious  goal, programs can have none or little consciousness. 

Energy is about calories burnt in brains, muscles, engines to manage entropy, eg to build and deliver goods. Thus money is a medium of energy. Each payment triggers burn out of energy to build and deliver goods and services. The monetary equivalent of energy spend due to payments each year is c.$90tn - Gross Global Product. Future money or energy spent is capitalization. 

Now you know that you are a part of the program evolving to maximize capitalization. Your program is your DNA, some knowledge, and most of all values or culture. Add some proteins (built as encoded in your DNA), your connections (build as encoded in your culture) and you have your machine which is a part of a larger machine which has a goal to maximize capitalization. If you help the machine it will likely reward you. If you make impediments, the immune system should work out (otherwise the machine will lose to a healthier machine).

Wartime Principles

In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat.

Ben Horowitz:

“Definitions and Examples

Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage vs. the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the company’s strengths.

In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources including competition, dramatic macro economic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth. The great wartime CEO Andy Grove marvellously describes the forces that can take a company from peacetime to wartime in his book Only The Paranoid Survive.

A classic peacetime mission is Google’s effort to make the Internet faster. Google’s position in the search market is so dominant that they determined that anything that makes the Internet faster accrues to their benefit as it enables users to do more searches. As the clear market leader, they focus more on expanding the market than dealing with their search competitors. In contrast, a classic wartime mission was Andy Grove’s drive to get out of the memory business in the mid 1980s due to an irrepressible threat from the Japanese semiconductor companies. In this mission, the competitive threat—which could have bankrupted the company—was so great that Intel had to exit its core business, which employed 80% of its staff.

In my personal experience, I was a peacetime CEO for about 9 months, then a wartime CEO for the next 7 years. My greatest management discovery through that transition was that peacetime and wartime require radically different management styles. Interestingly, most management books describe peacetime CEO techniques while very few describe wartime. For example, a basic principle in most management books is that you should never embarrass an employee in a public setting. On the other hand, in a room filled with people, Andy Grove once said to an employee who entered the meeting late: “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time.” Why such different approaches to management?

In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company’s survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy—a classic wartime scenario. He needed everyone to move with precision and follow his exact plan; there was no room for individual creativity outside of the core mission. In stark contrast, as Google achieved dominance in the search market, Google’s management fostered peacetime innovation by enabling and even requiring every employee to spend 20% of their time on their own new projects.

Peacetime and Wartime management techniques can both be highly effective when employed in the right situations, but they are very different.  The Peacetime CEO does not resemble the Wartime CEO.

Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO

Peacetime CEO knows that proper protocol leads to winning. Wartime CEO violates protocol in order to win.

Peacetime CEO focuses on the big picture and empowers her people to make detailed decisions. Wartime CEO cares about a speck of dust on a gnat’s ass if it interferes with the prime directive.

Peacetime CEO builds scalable, high volume recruiting machines. Wartime CEO does that, but also builds HR organizations that can execute layoffs.

Peacetime CEO spends time defining the culture. Wartime CEO lets the war define the culture.

Peacetime CEO always has a contingency plan. Wartime CEO knows that sometimes you gotta roll a hard six.

Peacetime CEO knows what to do with a big advantage. Wartime CEO is paranoid.

Peacetime CEO strives not to use profanity. Wartime CEO sometimes uses profanity purposefully.

Peacetime CEO thinks of the competition as other ships in a big ocean that may never engage. Wartime CEO thinks the competition is sneaking into her house and trying to kidnap her children.

Peacetime CEO aims to expand the market. Wartime CEO aims to win the market.

Peacetime CEO strives to tolerate deviations from the plan when coupled with effort and creativity.  Wartime CEO is completely intolerant.

Peacetime CEO does not raise her voice. Wartime CEO rarely speaks in a normal tone.

Peacetime CEO works to minimize conflict. Wartime CEO heightens the contradictions.

Peacetime CEO strives for broad based buy in. Wartime CEO neither indulges consensus-building nor tolerates disagreements.

Peacetime CEO sets big, hairy audacious goals. Wartime CEO is too busy fighting the enemy to read management books written by consultants who have never managed a fruit stand.

Peacetime CEO trains her employees to ensure satisfaction and career development. Wartime CEO trains her employees so they don’t get their ass shot off in the battle.

Peacetime CEO has rules like “we’re going to exit all businesses where we’re not number 1 or 2.”  Wartime CEO often has no businesses that are number 1 or 2 and therefore does not have the luxury of following that rule.

Can a CEO Be Both?

Can a CEO build the skill sets to lead in both peacetime and wartime?

One could easily argue that I failed as a peacetime CEO, but succeeded as a wartime one. John Chambers had a great run as peacetime CEO of Cisco, but has struggled as Cisco has moved into war with Juniper, HP, and a range of new competitors. Steve Jobs, who employs a classical wartime management style, removed himself as CEO of Apple in the 1980s during their longest period of peace before coming back to Apple for a spectacular run more than a decade later during their most intense war period.

I believe that the answer is yes, but it’s hard. Mastering both wartime and peacetime skill sets means understanding the many rules of management and knowing when to follow them and when to violate them.

Be aware that management books tend to be written by management consultants who study successful companies during their times of peace. As a result, the resulting books describe the methods of peacetime CEOs. In fact, other than the books written by Andy Grove, I don’t know of any management books that teach you how to manage in wartime like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove.”
